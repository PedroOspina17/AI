An ordinal variable is a categorical variable where the categories are numbers and the relative values of those numbers matter; however, the absolute values of those numbers does not. In other words, for a given ordinal variable $x$, a larger numbered category means \"more of $x$\" than a smaller numbered category; however, the category number does not indicate the actual amount of $x$. For example, here `age` is coded as an ordinal variable; the categorical value of `3` clearly indicates \"more age\" than the categorical value of `1` (35 - 50 years of age vs. under 25 years of age), but the specific category value `3` or `1` is meaningless.\n",

It's coded as a categorical variable taking the values `Main` for maintenance, `Prom` for promotions, and `Serv` for services.

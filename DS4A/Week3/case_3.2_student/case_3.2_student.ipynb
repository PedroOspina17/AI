    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we sought to understand crop production and yield patterns over seasons, years, and different geographies in order to gain insight into what can improve resilience to food shortages and ultimately international food security. In particular, we focused on how to improve poverty in Ethiopia through trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we saw that Brazil's and Ethiopia's coffee industries are likely not very comparable. However, the similarities and differences between Ethiopia's and Vietnam's are promising. The plots tentatively suggest that Ethiopia could develop its coffee industry by increasing the yield on its land, though more investigation is required to determine how Vietnam achieved such high yields (e.g. importing high-quality pesticides?), as well as by devoting more land to crops."

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you have further practiced your skills in reading charts and plots, gathering information, and assessing information sufficiency. You also saw that problems and questions can often be posed to you in vague and unanswerable ways, and that it is your job to narrow that down to a much more tractable hypothesis. You saw that a very effective way to do this was to read up on recent developments in the domain, in order to find something very specific with a more clear \"right/wrong\" answer. This again highlights a key point, which will come up again and again in this course: domain knowledge and/or expertise is essential to every part of the data science & analytics process.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this case, you should have an idea of how to frame an EDA process around a problem. For proficiency, we recommend that you practice this process on numerous data problems until you are confident in your ability to frame an EDA process regardless of domain expertise (this does not, however, undermine the absolute importance of domain expertise in helping you solve problems). We hope that you will fall back on the examples/concepts presented here when you reach a bottleneck in future EDA processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is no clear termination point in EDA - you are never officially *done*, but a good data scientist makes a judgement call on when EDA has been comprehensive enough for their purposes.\n",
    "2. Do not think only laterally & associatively, but rather deductively in a logical manner. We logically moved step by step from general crops to a specific coffee-focused strategy for Ethiopia as opposed to brainstorming a bunch of different crops at the outset, which would have created much more work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that you resolved the hypothesis at hand here was generally qualitative - through interpreting charts & graphs, and using logical thinking skills. In future cases, you will learn how to validate/invalidate hypotheses that you generate via more quantitative and technical methods."

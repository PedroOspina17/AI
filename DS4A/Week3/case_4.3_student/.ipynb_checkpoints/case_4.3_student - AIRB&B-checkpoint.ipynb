It is a large and lucrative market, but many vendors are simply individuals who are renting their own primary residence for short visits.

For Airbnb data, this is especially important, as Airbnb is often more expensive near holidays, and so reasonable price estimates must take this into account. In practice this is one of the most important corrections offered by Airbnb pricing consultancy firms, and corrections usually take advantage of data pooled from many somewhat similar cities. This is vital to achieving good corrections, but it is easy to make mistakes by failing to account for important city-to-city differences."

    "In this case, we saw that Airbnb prices are influenced by many factors. Some of the main ones include location, date, number of bedrooms, number of guests, and property type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any future model we build should feature these factors. Incorporating some of these factors, such as the number of bedrooms, should be straightforward, as this has a large and nearly linear relationship to price. But others, such as location, exhibit very non-linear relationships. We will learn how to deal with these types of complex relationships in future cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also found some surprising correlations, such as the negative correlation between price and parking. However, after breaking the data down by neighborhoods and incorporating the interaction effect of location, this negative correlation went away entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal effects are a very specific type of interaction effect which must be dealt with separately. Our exploration tells us that any model of AirBnB pricing should take into account strong seasonal components as well as strong spikes around major holidays. "

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you learned the following exploration process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by looking at the distributions of the available variables to look for interesting patterns and/or outliers.\n",
    "2. You can use a correlation matrix can quickly reveal the most promising candidate variables for further investigation.\n",
    "3. Using the various charts and plots at your disposal, investigate candidate variables in turn. Note which ones exhibit intriguing and unexpected correlations.\n",
    "4. Explore potential interaction effects for the variables exhibiting unexpected correlations. Suspected important interactions should be looked at directly with further plotting.\n",
    "5. Finally, take some time to carefully plot any interactions that you know to be important from domain knowledge. In our case, we looked at two features that are common to many datasets: location data and temporal data. Both of these contained very important signals that were immediately visually apparent, but which were strongly non-linear and could not easily be reduced to correlations or other simple summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be a bit daunting at first, but it is widely used by veteran data analysts and scientists and is extremely effective in most situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume this walkthrough was new to many of you, so there is a large amount of learning to digest here. We strongly recommend that you redo/review this case again by yourself until each step seems logical. It is crucial that you feel comfortable with this EDA process as we move towards later cases. By iteratively generating hypotheses throughout this process and investigating them, you can uncover great insight about what is going on without building a single formal model. Formal modeling will be discussed in future cases."

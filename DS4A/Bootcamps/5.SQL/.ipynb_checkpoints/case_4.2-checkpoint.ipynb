    "**Business Context.** You are a data consultant for the Boston Police Department. The department is looking to optimize its police deployment strategy so that it can tackle the most crimes as they occur with the fewest number of resources. Furthermore, different groups within the department specialize in different types of crimes, so this must play into their overall strategy. They would like to look at crime statistics by district and by month, as well as visualize them on a map by crime type and by date.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your task is to **make an interactive dashboard that department heads can use to visualize crimes in the manners they indicated above.** The dashboard should be usable via a web browser like Chrome on the company's intranet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** In the current case, we will again be using Dash by Plotly to develop the dashboard. This time, we will be using the Kaggle dataset titled \"Crimes in Boston\" found here: https://www.kaggle.com/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston. Unlike the first case, we will put this case together in an `app.py` file. We will also be using a SQLite database as the source of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case is structured as follows: you will (1) understand the data and plan the appropriate setup of the app to address the business problem; (2) set up the map component and various selectors to filter on the crime data; (3) set up a few additional plots to visualize crime by geography and time; and finally (4) use our completed app to derive insights."

This means that `DISTRICT` and `MONTH` are important to us, but `DAY_OF_WEEK`, `HOUR`, `REPORTING_AREA`, and `STREET` are not (because they are too granular). However, `YEAR` is relevant because it is a higher-level clarification of `MONTH` (e.g. \"December 2015\" is an important clarification of \"December\"). `OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP` is important because the department has different groups that specialize in different types of crimes, so analyzing that ensures that we don't deploy the wrong specialists to the wrong locations.\n",

    "By the end of this case, you should be very comfortable writing your own functions using `pandas` and applying them to entire datasets. You'll understand how functions work in Python, including anonymous functions (using the keyword `lambda`), and you'll feel comfortable analyzing and manipulating larger datasets. You'll also have gained experience with exploring a dataset that is only loosely organised and about which you have very little initial information."

    "**Business Context.** Global electricity production, consumption, import, and export is complex and interesting for a variety of reasons. Each country has to keep track of a vast array of information to ensure that they produce enough electricity, yet balance these needs against medium-term financial implications and environmental concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an analyst working at a non-governmental organization (NGO) that reports on global energy trends. Your department has acquired a large CSV file, but your colleagues are battling to extract relevant insights from it using Excel due to its size and format. Worse still, it has thousands of variables and they are not sure which ones are interesting. Thus, you have been made responsible for supporting your team's journalists by providing them with data and insights that they can turn into written reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.**  Your task is to **break the available data down into smaller files, understand the information that is available, and extract key insights for an upcoming report on global power patterns.** Specifically, your team wants you to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How much power is produced?\n",
    "* How much power is consumed?\n",
    "* How much power is imported and exported? \n",
    "* How much of this power is renewable?\n",
    "* How are these trends in production, consumption, import, and export changing over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The data is stored in a large CSV file containing information on power production and consumption by country and year. You will: 1) break down the data into summarized CSV files to share with your colleagues; 2) manipulate the data to create more categories from the existing columns; 3) find the biggest players in different categories, including total energy export and total production by type (e.g. nuclear); and finally 4) find trends in the data, such as which countries have the fastest growing energy production."

Not all numerical data in the `quantity` column is directly comparable. For example, sometimes the number in this column is defined in terms of \"Metric tons, thousand\" and sometimes in \"Kilowatt-hours, million\" -- evidently very different concepts!\n",

Instead of giving our function a name (`clean_transaction_description`), we can declare an anonymous function by using the [`lambda`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp) keyword. This says that we are going to pass in a series of `x` values (the descriptions), and describes what to do to each of them. The advantage of doing this is that it's more concise. The disadvantage is that it can be harder to read and it prevents us from using our function again later without redefining it all over again."

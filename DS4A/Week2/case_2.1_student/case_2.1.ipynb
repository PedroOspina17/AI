    "**Business Context.** Animal models are commonly used to study spinal cord injuries in humans. Thus, technological advances made in veterinary medicine for spinal cord injury (and other areas that commonly rely on animal models) are often made with an eye towards the eventual development of a product for humans.  One such advancement is the development of a SNAP test (a test that can be run in a few minutes from a single blood draw) that can be used to predict if the patient will likely recover from the injury.  This information is valuable for doctors and clinical practitioners.  If the information collected in the SNAP test proves to have sufficient predictive power, then investigators will pursue a patent and bring the product to market. The primary alternative to a SNAP test is a traditional lab test which is more time and resource intensive; the time required to obtain results from a traditional lab test delays treatment decisions which can adversely affect patient outcomes.

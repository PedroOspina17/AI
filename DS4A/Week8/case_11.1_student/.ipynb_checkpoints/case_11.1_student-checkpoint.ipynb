    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** Traditional commercial banks typically did not rely on statistical modeling to decide whether personal loans should be issued, although this is changing rapidly nowadays. You are a data scientist working in a modern commercial bank. Your data science team has already built simple regression models for predicting the probability that those loans would be defaulted on. However, you have noticed that many of these models perform much worse in production than they do in testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your task is to **build a default probability model that you feel comfortable putting into production**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The dataset contains the details of 5000 loan requests that have been previously issued by your bank. For each loan, the final status of the loan (i.e. whether the loan defaulted) is also available:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The file **\"loan_light.csv\"** contains the details of 5000 loans\n",
    "2. The file **\"loan_param.xlsx\"** contains the description of each covariate\n",
    "\n",
    "The case will proceed as follows: you will 1) perform some data exploration to determine the appropriate variable transformations to make; 2) fit some simple models; 3) learn about **cross-validation** and use this to select the best simple model; and finally 4) responsibly construct more complex models using cross-validation."

It is chiefly used to flag overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation works as follows: one splits the available data into $k$ sets, or **folds**. $k - 1$ of these folds will be used to train the model, while the held-out fold will be used as the test set on which the model is evaluated. For computational stability, this procedure is generally split many times, such that each fold has an opportunity to serve as the test set. For each repetition, a metric of prediction performance (e.g. AUC) is calculated on the test set. The average of these metrics, as well as their standard deviation, is then reported. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no exact science for choosing a proper $k$ for your dataset. It depends on what type of data you are using and how large it is. The larger $k$ is, the most iterations you run which lowers the chance you get \"unlucky\"; however, running more iterations can be costly in some cases. Additionally, it is important to make sure no matter what $k$ you choose that the validation set is still large enough to be meaningful. If you have a data set of 100 points and choose a $k$ of 20, then the validation set will only be 5 points. It is likely some iterations will perform poorly simply because the validation set is too small and potentially too different from the training set.\n",

It is especially useful in big data settings where the number of features is large compared to the number of observations. When used appropriately, cross-validation is a powerful method for choosing a model with the correct complexity and best predictive performance. Remember that logistic regression is only one of many classification algorithms and the principles behind cross-validation are not limited to this case alone. In fact, we highly recommend utilizing cross-validation for your linear regression models as well to prevent overfitting."

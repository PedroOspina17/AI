    "**Business Context.** Traditional commercial banks typically did not rely on statistical modeling to decide whether personal loans should be issued, although this is changing rapidly nowadays. You are a data scientist working in a modern commercial bank. Your data science team has already built simple regression models for predicting the probability that those loans would be defaulted on. However, you have noticed that many of these models perform much worse in production than they do in testing.\n",

    "**Answer.** This is also a bad idea. If we *blindly* use all of the variables in our model fitting, a phenomenon called [**overfitting**](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-are-overfitting-and-underfitting-in-machine-learning-a96b30864690) occurs. This is when a statistical model \"fits\" too closely to a particular set of data, which may well be noisy and exhibit randomness and therefore fail to predict future, different observations reliably."

    "[**Cross-validation**](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-and-how-to-cross-validate-a-model-d6424b45261f) is a set of techniques for assessing how well the results of a model will generalize to an out-of-sample dataset; i.e. in practice or production. It is chiefly used to flag overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation works as follows: one splits the available data into $k$ sets, or **folds**. $k - 1$ of these folds will be used to train the model, while the held-out fold will be used as the test set on which the model is evaluated. For computational stability, this procedure is generally split many times, such that each fold has an opportunity to serve as the test set. For each repetition, a metric of prediction performance (e.g. AUC) is calculated on the test set. The average of these metrics, as well as their standard deviation, is then reported. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no exact science for choosing a proper $k$ for your dataset. It depends on what type of data you are using and how large it is. The larger $k$ is, the most iterations you run which lowers the chance you get \"unlucky\"; however, running more iterations can be costly in some cases. Additionally, it is important to make sure no matter what $k$ you choose that the validation set is still large enough to be meaningful. If you have a data set of 100 points and choose a $k$ of 20, then the validation set will only be 5 points. It is likely some iterations will perform poorly simply because the validation set is too small and potentially too different from the training set.\n",

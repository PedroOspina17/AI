    "More specifically, machine learning is \"mechanical\" in the sense that how these algorithms \"learn\" is strictly based upon mathematical principles. For example, linear regression is an algorithm that learns by adjusting the coefficients of the input data to best predict an output value. How the coefficients change is entirely based on mathematical protocols (in this case, the gradients of the input data). A common application of linear regression would be predicting housing prices based on various input data such as size, number of rooms, and age of the house. The model would take in the data and learn from it by choosing the set of coefficients that minimizes the error of its predictions vs. actual prices."

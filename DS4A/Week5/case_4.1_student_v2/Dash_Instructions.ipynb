    "\n",
    "First make sure you have downloaded Case 4.1. This case contains a pair of folders named `App` and `App_solutions`. You will work within these folders during class. Even though we will be using Jupyter Notebook during class, you are welcome to use your favorite Python IDE to modify the files in these folders while creating your app. "

    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** You are a data analyst at a large financial services firm that sells a diverse portfolio of products. In order to make these sales, the firm relies on a call center where sales agents make calls to current as well as prospective customers. The company would like you to dive into their data to devise strategies to increase their revenue or reduce their costs. Specifically, they would like to double down on their most reliable customers, and to cut out sales agents whom are not producing outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** The business would like to answer the following questions: **\"What types of customers are most likely to buy our product? And which of my sales agents are the most/least productive?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The data is split across 3 tables: \"Agents\", \"Calls\", and \"Customers\", which sit on CSV files. Unlike previous cases though, we will first be reading these CSV files into a SQLite database created within Python. You will learn how this database differs from CSV files and how to interact with it using SQL to extract useful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case is sequenced as follows: you will (1) learn the fundamentals of databases and SQL; (2) use SQL `SELECT` statements to identify potentially interesting customers; and (4) use SQL aggregation functions to compute summary statistics on your agents and identify the most/least productive ones."

    "While we have been dealing with data sitting in CSV files so far, no serious data organization runs their operations off of CSV files on a single person's computer. This practice presents all sorts of hazards, including but not limited to:\n",

    "1. Destruction of that single device\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, our data should be stored elsewhere if we want to reliably access it in the future and, more importantly, share it and work on it with others. The **database** is the classic location where modern organizations have chosen to store their data for professional use. Databases have been a topic of research since the late 1960s. Many technology vendors picked up on this and developed databases software for companies to consume. Some of these vendors and products are:\n",

Comparing ```MySQL``` vs. ```PostgreSQL```, the two most popular database systems, MySQL does not implement ```FULL JOINS``` (you will learn about ```JOIN```s later on). PostgreSQL also supports some more advanced aggregation functions for statistics (you will learn about these soon). For example, in PostgreSQL you can perform regressions directly on the data before retrieving it, whereas MySQL only supports basic stats operations. However, this overhead leads to a slight performance hit, making MySQL faster for simple retrieval tasks.\n",

    "### Relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common database type is called a **relational database**, and the systems that manage these kinds of databases are called **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**. Relational databases date back to the early 1970s and can be considered the first type of database ever conceived. Continuing with our sock example, this drawer would have many identical slots, each for one pair of socks. The socks may be of different materials, colors, brands, etc., but they need to fit into a slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases deal with “relational data”, which is a fancy way of saying “tabular” data. This kind of dataset consists of rows and columns (i.e. tables) where each row corresponds to an observation and each column corresponds to an attribute of that observation. So, for example, if we go back to the example where we were keeping track of our friends and their phones, each row on the file (or table) represents one friend and each column represents the information we want to track about that friend (name and phone number). The cell on the intersection of the row and column contains the actual data. Relational data is manipulated using a specific language called **SQL (Structured Query Language)**, which we will learn about soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to conceptualize a table inside a relational database is as a CSV file “copied” to the database. In fact, many databases offer that possibility (assuming your file is correctly formatted, of course)."

    "### NoSQL databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Around 20 years ago, with the advent of the Internet and the necessity to store and process unstructured data (i.e. data that does not fit well in the row-by-column paradigm), developers started to discuss another type of database, which eventually ended up being referred to as a **NoSQL database**. These databases are not relational and are also built with more “relaxed” rules compared to their predecessors. NoSQL databases are more like a big drawer without slots and not exclusively for socks. You may choose to use this drawer primarily for socks of all sizes - small ones, big ones, maybe even a loose sock by itself - but it could also contain other items like sweaters or pants.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As the name implies, NoSQL databases do not rely on SQL, although many of them do allow you to use SQL to interface with them. At its core, a NoSQL database is simply a key-value store. That is, everything you store (sometimes called a **document**) in this database has a key associated with it. The database's job is simply to help you retrieve your desired document as quickly as possible. Nothing pre-determines what a document contains (i.e. it does not have a concept of \"tables\"); however, this flexibility comes at a price. When you retrieve a document, you have to perform extra checks on it to ensure its validity as the database will not automatically do this for you as it would with a relational database. This may or may not be desireable depending on your particular application."

    "Picking between RDBMS vs. NoSQL really comes down to the requirements of your project. We touched on this above, but both systems prioritize different parts of the [**CAP Theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem). Simply put, the CAP Theorem says that a database system can't have all three of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Every read of the database will return the most up-to-date write version or an error\n",
    "- **Availability**: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most up-to-date write version\n",
    "- **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to operate no matter the network quality between nodes\n",
    "    \n",
    "NoSQL prefers to be partition tolerant over consistent whereas RDBMS is the opposite. In certain applications, consistency is imperative which often forces you into using RDBMS. For example, if you are a bank and you query a customer's balance, you want to guarantee that the number you get is the most recent one and not the one from yesterday.\n",

As you become more proficient with SQL, you can try the non-commercial version of SQL Server as it offers a lot of advanced features as well as an excellent tool to manage the database (SQL Server Management Studio), and furthermore it is very likely that your organization has a SQL Server database laying around. Later, we will also use Amazon RDS in order to work with databases in-cloud. (Don't worry if you don't understand these concepts yet; we will cover them in the upcoming cases!)\n",

    "\n",

    "3. Choose \"PostgreSQL\" as the database type, leave the version at the default AWS has chosen for you (11.6-R1 at the time of writing), and choose \"Free Tier\"\n",

    "5. Under the next section, choose a name for your database instance. Remember this is the machine that is hosting the database software, not the database itself (one RDS instance can host many databases), so I'm calling mine `ds4a-demo-instance` to reflect this, although we'll only be creating a single database for now. \n",

Usually, you'll set up an RDS instance to play with other infrastructure within your AWS account, such as EC2 servers. In our case, we want to push data in and out of the database directly from our local machine as the client, so we'll have to set our database up for \"public access\". This is generally less secure, but we'll add some firewall rules in a bit to make sure that only we can access it:\n",

If you are using public WiFi, a hotspot, or if you think your IP address is likely to change soon for any reason, note that you'll have to modify this security group any time your IP address changes:\n",

At the top, there'll be a notification where you can press \"View credential details\" to access your master password that was automatically generated. **Take note of this as you can only see it once.** Note: this creates a database in the default VPC. If your default VPC is not configured for DNS connections, you will need to create a new VPC. Please see 'Appendix 1: Troubleshooting RDS creation' for instructions on how to do achieve this.\n",

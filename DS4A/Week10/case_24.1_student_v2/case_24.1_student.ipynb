    "In this case, you will create a **recommendation system** for movies using **[collaborative filtering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) (CF)**. Collaborative filtering is built upon users' reviews on a list of items and utilizes users' past behavior to recommend items that they haven't tried yet but might be interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary approaches to CF: **neighborhood-based comparison** and **latent factor modeling**. The former is concerned with computing the relationships between items or between users. In the latter approach, you have a model of hidden factors through which users and items are transformed to the same space. For example, if you are rating movies we may transform items into different genres and users into their preference for a particular genre. By the end of the case, you will learn how to do CF using both approaches."

    "**Business Context.** Most online commercial enterprises use automated recommendation systems to increase customer engagement. An efficient and accurate recommendation system connects customers with businesses and services that they have never used before, but would very likely engage with. You are the chief engineer of a start-up company that aims to provide personalized entertainment experiences. Your firm wants you to build a recommendation system that suggests movies and TV shows that cater to users' tastes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your main task is to use the reviews your users have written for movies and TV shows in Amazon **to build an automatic recommendation system that predicts how likely it is that a user will enjoy a movie, based on which you will also generate a list of movies/TV shows the user has never seen before but would likely enjoy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The outline of this case is as follows: we will (1) create a database of item-item similarities and use this to implement a neighborhood-based CF recommender that can answer simple questions like \"give me more movies like this one\". This part of the case assumes that the similarities calculated make good \"global recommendations\"; (2) go one step further and attempt to predict the rating that a user will give a movie they have not seen before. This requires that we find the movies that *this* user would rate as similar (not just those which are similar across the board); and finally (3) implement a latent factor-based CF recommender using a non-negative matrix factorization."

    "## Neighborhood Based Comparison vs. Latent Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, there are two primary approaches to CF: **neighborhood-based comparison** and **latent factor modeling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original approaches to neighborhood-based CF used user-user models. This means that we would estimate the rating a particular user would give a particular item based on actual ratings that other, similar users gave that item. However, since most users tend to rate very few items, this is usually not the best way to construct ratings-focused recommendation systems. Thus, most neighborhood-based systems these days (e.g. Amazon) rely on item-item approaches. In this approach, a rating is estimated using rating that the particular user gave other, similar items; i.e. we effectively have a sort of $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent factor models generally lead to more accurate recommendations. One of the reasons for this is the sparsity of the item-user matrix. Most users tend to rate barely one or two items. Latent factor models are more expressive, and fit fewer parameters. However, neighborhood models are more prevalent, as they have an intuitive aspect that appeals to users (if you liked this you will like that) and on-line (a new preference can be incorporated very quickly)."

The distribution of number of reviews per movie generally clusters under 200. This means that most movies do not get any comments from more than $1 - \\frac{2189650}{2189850}\\approx 0.01\\%$ users. These numbers may suggest that the dataset is quite sparse; i.e. it contains a lot of \"missing data\".

    "\n",
    "Let's now create a smaller dataset in DataFrame `smalldf` by looking for those movies with more than 2,200 reviews (hot/classic movies) and those users with more than 65 reviews. Note that while this cut makes sure we have prolific users, the cut on movies restores sparsity by reducing the number of reviews per user. We also include in `smalldf` a column `user_mean` to indicate the average rating a user gives and a column `movie_mean` to indicate the average rating this movie receives. After the initial filtering, we further remove users that now have fewer than 6 reviews and movies with fewer than 3 reviews:"

    "### The latent factor model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The central idea in constructing a recommendation system using collaborative filtering is that *similar users will rate similar movies similarly*. In the previous sections, we explicitly implemented this idea by using similarity measure. We also assumed that either all users were the same (the global approach) or that only the current user was similar enough to make a recommendation (the user-specific approach). In this section, we will use a model that allows us to identify both similar users and similar movies as a function of **latent factors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of latent factors as properties of movies (e.g., genre, price, running time) that users have a positive or negative preference for. We do not observe these factors or the users' preferences directly, but we assume that they affect how users tend to rate movies. For example, an extremely long movie would receive a low rating if the reviewer prefers fast-paced titles. Note that if users have similar preferences, then according to the model, they will behave similarly, and likewise, if movies have similar latent factors, they will be rated similarly by similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue that comes up with latent factor models is determining how many latent factors to include. We can deal with the problem of choosing the number of latent factors with cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rating model specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the actual rating of movie $m$ from user $u$ as $Y_{um}$. In our dataset, we have $N$ distinct users and $M$ distinct movies. Not all combinations of movies and users have ratings. We assume there are $L$ reviews in total. The latent factor model we specify assumes that each movie is associated with a $K$-dimensional latent factor $v_m$ and each user is associated with a $K$-dimensional latent factor $w_u$. Furthermore, we assume that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_{um} = v_m^\\intercal w_u\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that under this model specification, if two movies have very similar $v_m$, the associated score $Y$ from any user should be similar. And if two users have very similar $w_u$, their ratings for any movie should also be very similar. The following figure provides a very clear summary of the model specification:\n",

    "*Image from this [website](https://medium.com/@connectwithghosh/simple-matrix-factorization-example-on-the-movielens-dataset-using-pyspark-9b7e3f567536)*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimation for this model\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this model, we want to estimate $v$ and $w$ for all users and all movies, before which $K$ is also important to determine. There are numerous ways to estimate these quantities but we are going to focus on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in this section. The idea of this approach is that both $w$ and $v$ have to be non-negative vectors. This constraint makes the prediction for any unobserved review non-negative and discourages extremely high predicted ratings, which is the major advantage of the NMF approach compared to the approach we introduced previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what the implementation of the matrix factorization we are using, the ultimate goal in estimation is to approximate the observed ratings as closely as possible. This is usually achieved by minimizing the mean squared error of the predicted ratings for reviews that are available in the training dataset.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we constructed recommedation systems for movies based solely on reviews data. Our first recommender examined the correlation between reviews of common reviewers and used the correlation to assign similarity between movies. We also introduced an alternative recommendation system constructed by directly decomposing the item-user matrix into low-dimensional latent factors and used the identified latent factors to estimate a user's rating for a yet un-viewed movie. By sorting the estimated rating, a list of recommended items can be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that the first approach tends to have lower bias but higher variance whereas the second approach produces low variance predictions with elevated bias. We also note that the second approach is computationally more efficient. Considering the fact that the data available to us will continue to increase, the second approach is probably the better choice."

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we introduce two approaches for movie recommendation: nearest-neighbor approach and matrix factorization approach. Both approaches are proposed to deal with the high sparsity in review dataset and each with its own pros and cons. We find in general, matrix factorization approach is computationally more efficient with smaller uncertainty for the predicted ratings. Nearest-neighbor approach on the other hand, is computationally intensive due to the calculation of pairwise similarity. It is more unstable in prediction for ratings compared to MF approach but has smaller bias. Unfortunately, neither of these two approaches can deal with the issue of new item. In our next case, we should address this issue by using external information about users and movies."

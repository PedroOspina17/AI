    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** Your friends want to open a sandwich shop in an area surrounded by office buildings. This sounds like a good business opportunity! However, new ventures, especially in the restaurant business, require careful planning to increase the likelihood of having a successful opening and subsequent business. A key aspect of this planning is to get a good grip on what your potential customers would like to order and what the popular items on the menu will be. Your friends will conduct a survey in order to obtain better knowledge of the preferences of our potential costumers. However, they are unsure of who to send out the survey to, so they have hired you as a consultant to help them figure this out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your task is to **devise a plan for how to select people from the potential customer base to send a survey to, while still obtaining answers helpful for planning the menu.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The case will proceed as follows: you will (1) understand some more background on the problem and pull in the data; (2) learn about and use some simple methods of sampling our population; (3) look at shortcomings of those simple methods and turn to more sophisticated methods instead; and finally (4) implement those complex methods and analyze the results."

    "## Background on the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Your new sandwich shop will be located in a busy neighborhood in Bogot√°, and you have estimated that there are about 100,000 potential customers. There is a mix of residential and commercial buildings around your shop. In such a scenario, it is infeasible, and at best impractical, to ask every potential customer about their preferences. We need to find a way to select a sample set of individuals whose answers, when put together, will provide useful information for creating a menu for the entire potential customer base."

    "### Designing survey questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing survey questions requires careful thought and some domain expertise. After consulting with experts in the restaurant planning business, we have planned to ask the the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What kind of meat/veggie do you prefer? (a) steak (b) roasted veggies (c) chicken (d) ham\n",
    "2. What is your preference for cheese? (a) provolone (b) Swiss (c) cheddar (d) doble crema\n",
    "3. What is your preference for bread? (a) white (b) wheat (c) rye (d) artisinal\n",
    "4. Do you prefer to eat out for lunch or dinner? (a) lunch (b) dinner\n",
    "5. What is your preference for dessert? (a) oblea (b) tres leches (c) arequipe (d) ice cream\n",
    "6. What days do you prefer to eat out? (a) weekdays (b) weekends\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions will help us put together a nice menu. This is a great start; however, putting together a survey that proves useful to our enterprise requires more than just asking a few good questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the task is to *devise a plan for how to select people from the potential customer base to send a survey to while still obtaining answers helpful for planning the menu*. This involves more than just knowing what questions to ask; it involves knowing the profiles of people to ask and how to source those people!"

We might choose our clusters randomly, or have other domain-specific reasons to believe that they are representative of the population.\n",

For example, we may not have access to the proportions of people that fall under each category for the population as a whole, but we can figure this out for Building 1. Then, we treat Building 1 as our entire population, and can perform stratified sampling for categories within this population.\n",

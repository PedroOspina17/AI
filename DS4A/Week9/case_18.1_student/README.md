Set up instructions
If you are using docker, after running your normal `pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt`
run the following command `pip install --upgrade numpy pandas`

If you are using Windows and have issues going through your normal `pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt`
refer to the `environment-setup.pdf` and use the `win_env.yml`. If that still present an issue then refer
to the `colab_instructions.md`

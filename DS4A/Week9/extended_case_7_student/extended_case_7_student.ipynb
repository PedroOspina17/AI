    "**Business Context.** You are a data scientist working for a machine learning consultancy. One of your clients wants to be able to classify text reviews automatically by the likely rating (on a 1 - 5 scale) that that person would give. However, they do not have sufficient data they generated on their own to do this, so you need to use an external, rich dataset as a basis on which to build your model and then translate it over.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** We'll use the Amazon review dataset again and try to classify reviews into star ratings automatically. Instead of just positive and negative, we'll take on the harder challenge of predicting the *exact* star rating. The lowest score is 1 and the highest is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to optimize by pre-processing the text, we'll do very basic tokenization and experiment with different neural network models, architectures, and hyperparameters to optimize the results. You'll start by building a simple dense neural network and try to get it to perform better using various techniques. Then you'll evaluate the results and diagnose where it tends to perform more poorly."

       "'Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \"Jumbo\". My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. Ive noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat. The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I dont like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go. Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!! Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought Id found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness Id eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their hearts content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case youre like me, ... its not you ...its the maltitol! No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks. I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.  He wouldnt eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea.  We will not be buying this again.  Its also super expensive. These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. Im not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy. Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor. I dont know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldnt cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I cant even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away. Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor. To me, these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints. They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin, and thats as far as it goes. The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. Im not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes. At this point, I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints. As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get \"upset\" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasnt until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and havent suffered one bit like our dogs have.Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible! Hey, the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $4.00 per can. No way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can. This candy is not as described. The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described.Looks and tastes like its way past its expiration date.Would never reccommend this. Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing Terrible! Artificial lemon taste, like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish. Dont do this to yourself. Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest. Five minutes in, one tentacle was bitten off, ball inside cracked in half. Not durable enough to be a dog toy. Disappointed :(. So is the dog :(. I felt energized within five minutes, but it lasted for about 45 minutes. I paid $3.99 for this drink. I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money. I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership. I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.Im just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice. I paid $1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today. I bought them because brown rice is a \"good\" carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have \"Masa corn flour\" listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I wont buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste. This is the first time Ive really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought Id try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and dont work, dont buy this! I dont know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions. I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 3/4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit, covered for 5min. It was mushy and tasteless.We have thrown out the rest of the container. I wouldnt even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit. How can I compare other items online or in a store? So we cancelled the order.  It was cancelled without any problem.  That is a positive note... I received the items in a timely manner. Upon receipt, I removed a pack to consume. The pop-tart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth. Taste like it is stale.  Will not order this again.  I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it.  This stuff tasted NOTHING, like the Douwe Egberts at the hall.  This is possibly stale coffee. Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent. The product was not. Will not order again. Bad taste. Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes. I throw it right away, i coudl not drink it. A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and/or honey. Definately not my cup of coffee. Oh, did i say it was bitter? These condiments are overpriced and terrible. The classic is disgustingly sweet. The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant. I havent used the ham base. It is loaded with MSG. I did not realize this when I ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping. Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box. 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top. There were no tears in the packages. Just awful!  I thought food was supposed to taste good!  I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth, its that bad. Perhaps the worst bottle of wine Ive ever had. Im not even sure I would cook with this. It is thin, no body, and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot.  The taste is just bitter - not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price. Just not what Im looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir. Maybe my bottle wasnt sealed well and went to vinegar - other reviews for this wine are favorable. A vile, miserable pancake. I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried. I dont know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste. Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix. The buttermilk, baking soda (SLS) and sea salt are not. I am going back to Natures Path Buttermilk pancake mix. This one went straight into the garbage. These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case \"& Chive\") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully theyll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips. Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite. These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could. I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  \"What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes \"cheaper\". I dont know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.\"  I did receive a reply: \"Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the \"best before\" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.\"  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the \"bad\" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same... When originally produced in England  these were the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame. after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen? Ive bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one.  Unedible.  Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same. Kettle Brand chips used to be so good...oily, crunchy, flavorful. I suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse. Now theyre no better than any other big name brand chip. Try the Good Health Kettle Style Olive Oil chips instead. They are as good as the Kettle Brand once was. R.I.P., Kettle Brand chips. :( ...you can absolutely forget about these. Confirmed by other reviewers, these chips are now total garbage. Like chewing on styrofoam packaging \"peanuts\". Positively awful, no hyperbole or exaggeration. Ill NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again! From a reportedly once great \"premium\" brand, literally any mass market chip Ive ever tried tastes better than these. Stale and rancid tasting, and virtually no salty taste whatsoever. Completely awful! These chips are nasty.  I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag, no the chips were just soaked with grease.  Nasty!! I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I dont know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more. I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORSSALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPERTUSCAN 3 CHEESEN.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERSTHEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS. I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others. These chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it (especially at the bottom of the bag. Even if they are trans fat free, they need to be a lot less greasy. Dont waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips.  I bought a case of these, and a case of the cheddar and sour cream.  Both cases ended up in the garbage can. DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my familys favorite. Kettles are dark/burnt,more broken bits, taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch. Oh well. I love sour food but this one I cant bear.  Too strong sour taste... and even when you open the bag, the sour smell is too strong.  I dont like it. Unless you really really really like vinegar - AVOID! Those chips should have been called \"Vinegar and Sea Salt\" - not \"Sea Salt and Vinegar\". Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label \"yeast extract\".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore. The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so its hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? Its like a game of roulette. After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse.  Dont know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch.  When my son gets home, Im going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon.  The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, dont know which.  I will never buy these again from Amazon.  I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase.  It makes me sick to think about it!I included pictures at the top of the page.  Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.Update:  I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didnt want them. Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! Im stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper. Im very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now. Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar:  These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old.  I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then.  But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just dont hit the spot for me. For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didnt like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.Yuck!!! While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market. I Was sent 3 week past \"Fresh by date\" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Wont order again.EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.Very bad form amazon. and THAT is  the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring. I am very disappointed with this product because I could not see how many calories it has at the time I ordered it. I received it and now I can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon. Granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon. How could Agave Nectar be better than sugar? I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for. \"Yeast Extract\" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. Its just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing \"No MSG\" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities. Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously, I neglected to not look for the word: \"supreme\" in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered. We (that is my husband, guests and me)knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed. BUT, currently Amazon featured the \"supreme\" babka and now I am awaiting to receive these. In the future, I will read more carefully. I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust, rather than fluffy frosting.  The package recommended stirring before use, so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo.  The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in \"Better of Dead\" (no raisins in it though!).I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it.  When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife.I opted for making my own frosting instead - very easy!  A little Sprectrum palm shortening, a lot of powdered sugar, a tiny splash of vanilla, a tiny bit of salt, and rice milk as needed for consistency, beat for 5 minutes, and I had the fluffy butter cream frosting I thought Id get from Cherrybrook.I wonder if our can was overheated in the store (whole foods) or something...Ive read positive reviews of their frosting mix, so maybe Ill try that next time. I love Cherrybrook Kitchen and have tried almost all of their products.  I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.  I did not even try it on a cake, because the taste and texture were so off-putting.  Seriously, do not waste your money! This product was such a disappointment!  As all the other reviewers said, its a gluey, sticky texture more akin to Elmers Glue than to an edible food product.  The flavor was sickening sweet.  I actually thought that the frosting had spoiled.  It was that bad!  Save yourself the time and $$ (I paid $4.99) and make your own frosting or go with another brand.  Cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good.  Its hard to believe they even sell this. I am glad I found this on the reduced rack for 99c. The taste was not bad but no way I could frost my cake. It stuck to the knife,ran down in strings,what a mess. I too thought I had gotten a bad batch.My GDs birthday cake looks like crap. Who would buy this mess. Horrible I recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store... now I know why it was on sale!This is not a fluffy, creamy white frosting youd expect to find when opening the jar. Now, I wasnt expecting it to be just like Betty Crocker, but it was pretty bad. Like others said, it is a gluey/tacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on.  It reminds me of taffy that hasnt quite hit the right stage in the candy making process.  The taste isnt that great either, and its sickeningly sweet (even for frosting).  The only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns?  I still dont think it would be the right consistency... I can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought. Its kind of generous to call it frosting, it has more the consistency of rubber cement. And since we were in a time crunch, we didnt have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didnt even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece. A really ugly centerpiece, that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried. A watered down perversion of the acai berry.This juice comes on strong and harsh.  With tart aftertaste and no texture.Thats because it is mostly apple juice, grape juice, pomegranate juice, blackberry juice, blueberry juice, and tart cherry juice.  Oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoction.You shall not find that distinctive  smooth chocolaty acai flavor here.  There is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither.  For that exotic unique acai experience try Zola or Samzon  brands.Im not saying that this Lakewood juice product isnt nutritious.  Thats not my point.  Im saying that its a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice. This item, WERTHERS SUGAR FREE HARD CANDY, if consumed, will give you - or your friends, loose bowels. I purchased 12 bags and discovered more than a bowel problem: You cant return them. Need a laxative? I have ten unopened bags you can have - for free. This kind of tea not good ....!Taste and smell so wear its not like tea ,and feel like some thing chemical. The laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it. No other item inside our fridge turned bad. This is NOT Disco Dust which is edible and made for baking. DO NOT purchase this product for such purposes! I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. Its non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100s of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think its the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But its bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isnt good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one. This tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell: terrible.  It invigorates like a puncture wound, and the only revival is that, after drinking, you discover that you are still alive.Well, one tea bag was enough for me.  My mother-in-law said, \"Oh, that smells kind of like wine.\"  Okay, kind of like wine, with a hint of rot and a moldy aftertaste.  If she likes it, she can have the whole box. If it were possible to give this product zero stars, I would have done so.  I am a huge fan of Twinings teas, and was very excited to try this new blend.  After arriving home from the grocery, I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner.  Between sorting, washing, and chopping items, the hot water was added to the bag to steep.  Preparation continued, until a distinctly off odor hit me.  I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid!  I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea.  Even after cleaning up, and airing out the kitchen, my roommate later came in and asked about the smell.  Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product. The US made version of this Cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the UK version of the chocolate which I have been eating since childhood. I did not like this new taste. To all my friends from India -- buy this chocolate if it is either made in UK or India; otherwise you will be disappointed as I was. Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured.  New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia, etc.  This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England, Australia or New Zealand Cadbury.  It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently.If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey version.Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA. Not my idea of a good caramel.  Flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated.  Same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties. I missed the mix of rich, buttery, dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that I expect in caramels. This product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award. The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal, so at least 50% of the interior of the box is air. Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60% the length of a \"normal\" snack bar. The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, wont be disappointed in the taste of this one.Ive also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.I really want to like this company. They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. That is why Ive continued to try their products. I bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food Ive ever had. The \"clusters\" are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people.All in all I would not recommend Enjoy Life foods. My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant/toddler and we bought these bars consistently.  She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.  Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter wont eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!! Refer to the picture I posted above.  The bar is half the size you think it is going to be...It is literally a two-bite bar.  Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didnt like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldnt give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as Im concerned. Imagine taking some kids playground chalk, perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks. Then scoop it up and put it in your mouth.Thats how disgusting this bar is.I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful, IT HAS NONE. Ive done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store, take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps, if theres a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.\"Enjoy Life\" bars? Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth. Wow, i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars. The other posters say they notified Earths Best about this in August and they are still selling it without checking or recalling!! No more earths best for my little guy. I am taking my business elsewhere and I am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars. They gotta do better than this to get my business. My triplets will not eat this, eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING. The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon. I normally love Earths Best products (as does my son). However, tonight after Id given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it. I was appalled!  As this is my first child and I dont have any experience with this kind of thing, I called poison control. They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine, I got really angry. I looked it up online and found that Earths Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it. Dont buy Earths Best! Really disappointing. Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.  It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture.Pretty disappointing and a waste of money. To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible. Up all night screaming from gas pains. Garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies. This is my daughters  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones shell eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earths Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, thats it for us. I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old.  Plastic!!! in food!!!! baby food!!!  So please be careful if you buy this or are considering it.My daughter LOVES this food-- its actually her favorite.  This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months. I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappys Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought Id order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didnt taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didnt have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.Ive never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I dont know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I wont buy the teabags again. OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal. DEGUSTING isnt even a strong enough word. A horrible horrible mistake...an expensive mistake....they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookies....however when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay Ill try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DISGUTINGLY, MEDICINAL TASTE. DO NOT BUY!!! If they had a zero before the stars I would rate it a zero instead of 1 star. Not hot at all. Like the other low star reviewer, I got suckered by seeing habenero in the name and the 12 oz size. Some people might like the flavor, citrus-y and it has some fish sauce in the mix (according to the ingredient label), but if youre looking for hot this aint it The noodles in the box were all broken.  The sauce was over salted and did not have a good flavor.  I threw out most of the skillet.  I would recommend not purchasing this product. Its no secret that high fructose corn syrup is detrimental to your health. Unfortunately, its also no secret that it has replaced other forms of sugar in a disturbingly large number of manufactured foods. Even worse is that most high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified corn.Since the late 1980s, HFCS has replaced regular table sugar, honey, and similar sweeteners in practically everything. Prolonged consumption of HFCS is now the topic of much debate and we are learning that it can cause long-term damage to the body.High Fructose Corn Syrup Dangers1. Significant Risk of Weight Gain & Obesity2. Increased Risk of Developing Type-2 Diabetes3. Hypertension and Elevated \"Bad\" Cholesterol Levels4.  Long-Term Liver Damage5. Mercury Exposure from HFCSKelloggs and other manufacturers know this and are slowly getting rid of this sweetner. Look at the cover of Post Rain Bran. They are advertising that it contains NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.I applaud them for this. High Fructose Corn Syrup is made from genetically modified corn from Monsanto which uses systemic pesticides in their seeds which is causing Colony collapse disorder in bees. I am a bee keeper and have been avoiding all products with HFCS in them to save my family and the bees. Watch vanishing of the Bees,Food Matters and Food Inc. They are all sold on Amazon. Excellent movies which will change your health dramatically and the way you think and eat. Coffee beans did not seem fresh.  No oil on them what so ever.  I have tasted much better and fresher.  Will not order again. Tossed this out after trying it.  Texture and taste were far below expectations.  Seemed kind of mushy and pasty.  Pricy to boot. My cookies were in such tiny broken pieces ,they were useless. Upon complaint, a second mailing arrived several weeks later. The cookies were again in crumbs. The cookies were packed in  a box with a pitiful single air bubble. I gave this feedback and expected some effort to improve on the packing. But no, same packaging, same useless cookies.  Having enjoyed these Highlanders in the past, it was both a disappointment and a big waste of money. I purchased this product because of its name, \"Rumford NATURALS Corn Starch\" (the word \"Naturals\" appears large and clear on the pictured product label). Also, the Amazon description said it was made from \"Non-Genetically Modified Corn\". The label on the product that I ACTUALLY received does NOT say Rumford NATURALS, but it is still MADE WITH Non-Genetically Modified Corn. I say \"made with\" because this product now contains more than ONE ingredient. Its ingredients are: Cornstarch, Calcium Sulfate*, and ONE of the suggested servings (1 Tblsp) contains 15% of the \"Daily Value\" of CALCIUM. That makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation. ON THE OTHER HAND, for persons who must restrict their calcium intake (example, some persons with kidney stones), it can pose a potential problem, even danger. Amazon provides themselves with a nice \"out\" for this. They list the following: Legal Disclaimer: \"Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product.\" BUT, IT IS NOT FAIR FOR AMAZON TO NOT AT LEAST LIST THE CORRECT INGREDIENTS AND PHOTO OF THE PACKAGE SO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ORDER THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO \"READ LABELS\" AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED.I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN: * because I dont need extra calcium * because I dont believe that the Calcium Sulfate was added out of interest in the consumers health  but to make the product cheaper to produce so it can be priced competitively with other brands  and still be touted as having been made from/with Non-Genetically Modified Corn and just on principal because I cant afford to throw it away and did not want the hassle of returning it.I am very, very displeased with Amazons incorrect listing of the product, which was brought to their attention when I purchased it in February 2012, and so far nothing has been done.*Although Calcium Sulfate is considered a safe food additive it is basically the same thing as Plaster of Paris. AND, if you use too much of this product (basically the same amount as I had previous used of pure CORN STARCH), the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container (I make pudding in Pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every 30 seconds) will remind you of damp plaster! Was really bummed to find out that these chocolates had melted before they got to my daughter for her bday.  Seems that they should not be sold online if there is not a way to keep them safe.  :-( All my fault. I thought this would be a carton of 3 boxes of cereal.  Instead it was 1 box of cereal for 12.99. Who sells cereal for this price plus $8.00 shipping ? I feel stupid!  Buyer Beware! This is not jerky, this is processed, hard like a rock, very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you cant break into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat! The dogs- 45lb dogs that will eat anything- were not impressed, it was hard to chew, and it sounded like they were crunching rocks, most of them spat it out after a few chews, left it there, this would be the first time they would not eat something in their entire lives, these dogs will work for lettuce. Where is a zero star button? This is not jerky, this is processed, hard like a rock, very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you cant break into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat! The dogs- who will eat anything- were not impressed, it was hard to chew, and it sounded like they were crunching rocks, where is a zero star button? We have ordered Uncle Rays BBQ chips many times before. Always been pleased, except this order!  Just NOT the sameSeasoning as usual. Generally lacked much for taste! Not sure if they have reduced the seasoning, in their processing? But out of case we bought, we have opened and thrown away 3 bags already, VERY disappointed with this order! I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands Ive tried before. Theres a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that theyre as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just dont taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck! These had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning. The first 2 cases were amazing best i had ever. Then they restocked and tried 4-5 cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them. What a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money. Bad Uncle Ray! Bought Uncle Rays Wavys 16 oz potato chips because purchased  Uncle Rays 16 oz barbque potato chips in the past and was very pleased. Oh how wrong we were.  Do not purchase the Wavys chips!!!!!!!!!!  They are the quality of buying a no name bag of chips from a roadside service station store; broken, brown, very poor quality.  Very, very disappointed.  DO NOT.......DO NOT......DO NOT purchase Uncle Rays 16 oz Wavy potato chipsOCTOBER 03, 2012Bought Uncle Rays sour cream and onion flavored chips for the 5th shipment with extreme disappointment. The other (4) four shipments were very good which is why we continued to buy this flavor.The additive that when you like an item and start to buy a lot, it will change for the worse is proving to be true for us.  This shipment of chips are awful.  Bags are extremely deflated, so was expecting to be stale; however, was not so - cannot not explain the semi-flat bags.  Chips seem to be the bottom of the barrel flakes.  You know when you try to salt your food and the top comes off, the seasoning on these chips is like that.  It appears that the top came off a full bottle or these are the bottom of the barrel crumbled chips where the seasoning has covered the chips too, too much. .  We just opened (3)three bags just now because the first bags was awful, opened second bag - awful, opened 3rd bag - also was awful.  LEFT WITH 6 MORE ,PROBABLY NOT EDIBLE, BAGS. THE CHIPS REALLY APPEAR TO BE THE NOT SO FRESH, BURNED/BOTTOM OF THE BARREL, GET RID OF LEFTOVERS.  VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED.  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Be careful!  I ordered a pack of 6, my invoice says pack of 6, but I received only 1 stick. Even though the item says \"Pack of 6,\" I only received one. I called them up to see where the other 5 were, and they said that Amazon put it incorrectly. Seriously?? They are issuing a refund, but still. I wanted 6, which is what the item says, and instead and only getting the 1. Should we just not trust whats on Amazon now??? My cat will NOT eat this food. I dont know why, but it was a waste of money. I was looking for something cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. I just received these bricks today and was very disappointed to find that BOTH of the bricks were broken and unusable as a serving/cooking plate.  They were busted completed in half. They were packaged in one sleeve of small bubble wrap in a shallow box with no other protection or packaging in the box.  I went online to try and return them and they are not eligible for return.  This is the first return Ive ever tried to do in over 7 years of purchasing items off of amazon (to the tune of several orders a month!) and yet the one time that I want to return a defective product, I cant do it.  I will be much more careful about what is eligible for returns and what isnt in the future. Items in this Gift Basket was delivered to people who called me to say \"could not eat any of it, because everything was old and stale.\"  I was sad and disappointed. Time and effort, as well as money to get this, only to find out - terrible. Very disappointed with purchase.  The dates were so dried up where it tasted like leather instead of dates.  Must have been sitting there for a long long time. Buying this product seems to be almost literally like rolling the dice in a game of craps!My experience with this seems to be similar to the experience of \"Peter R.\", unfortunately.The price was excellent.  I ordered mine after the date of \" J. Robert Bois\" positive experience / review was written but before the date of \"Cindy 2366s\" positive experience / written review.  I bought these & gave them to my Dad, as he *LOVES* dates.  I noticed when I was visiting him, the dried fruit basket was hanging around in his fridge a lot longer than any other date basket I had ever ordered for him.Finally I asked him about them.  He said that he did not want to be rude to me or hurt my feelings but....  the dates, well, he was wondering if he should try & eat the seeds in the center & see if they were soft, because the dates themselves were hard as a rock & tasted stale.  I was mortified to say the least...  Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment.  (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.)Me personally, I have not tried them.  I will take his word for it!  :)I told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels.  After a week of offering the dates,  I picked them up out of his backyard and threw them away.  The squirrels, opossums, & raccoons declined to dine on the dates.It seems to be hit or miss with the \"Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patricks Dried Fruit Gift Basket\" purchase.I will not say flat out \"NO!  Do Not Purchase This Item, It is Not Good!\"  That is a choice you will have to make on your own.  I just wanted to pass along my experience with the gift basket.Thank Goodness I caught it when it was on special & did not have the full current purchase price invested in the box!  I would have been really sad then!Amazon, as usual, did a fabulous job with the shipping, packaging, and they arrived quickly, in the time frame advertised / promised.Best of luck & I hope others have better experiences than my Dad / I had!<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004134H9W\">Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patricks Dried Fruit Gift Basket</a> This vendor is unscrupulous. She ripped off her cultures from other collectors and shamelessly claims them as her own. She has no conscience and I would highly recommend that you do your purchasing elsewhere. This was a disappointment.  I use other products from this line/manufacturer on a regular basis.  I bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid Stevia in my purse.  The first time I went to use it, the liquid was a dark color...almost black..and I had to throw out the latte I was trying to sweeten.  All the manufacturers other liquid products are clear, and, in fact, this is titled \"clear liquid\".  It must have been outdated/spoiled. I had already thrown the packing out, so dont know how it was dated.  I tried calling the Amazon supplier, but the call rolled into voice mail.  Its not enough money to spend time following-up, but it was disappointing. I ordered these lollipops for a friends Wizard of Oz themed shower. The arrived packaged well but I noticed the box said theyre from \"Oriental Trading Company\".  If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However, from the picture these looked well made. The picture is very deceiving and so is the description. They show 16 same-colored lollipops...mine came in a variety of colors. They also gave dimentions that the lollipops were 6\"x2\". I noticed they looked a bit small and when I measured they didnt even come to 5\" long, not any of them...even though theyre all differnet lengths.  This was very disappointing since I planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops. Overall, Im very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product theyre providing to consumers. I purchased these to give to children who come to my place of business.  When they arrived, it says clearly on the back of the individual wrapper \"MADE IN CHINA.\"  NO WAY Im giving these to children if they were manufactured in China, following the whole poisoned pet food debacle.  The fact that these are made in China needs to be highlighted much more clearly. I purchased these for my candy buffet at my wedding and Im not impressed at all. I could have saved money by ordering them directly from Oriental Trading Company which is clearly where they came from. they look cheap and theyre not as colorful as shown in the picture. the Oriental Trading Company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops. most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken. the box only has 12 lollipops, but in the description it says theres 16. I would have expected that if I knew they were coming from Oriental Trading Company, but thats not in the description, so I feel ripped off. These lollipops are not as pictured. They came in assorted colors, some really drab, not the rainbow brights shown in the picture. They are also completely flat rather than being the rolled old fashioned candy style so they look cheap. I need them for a birthday party and I was really disappointed when I received them. I opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke, I was very disappointed.  They did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking.  You are better off buying them from a store around your area. This muffin mix is awful,..all you taste is flour and sour cream,.which is used to make these.  It just tastes wierd. Ive tried and tried,..there are no good tasting low carb \"treats\",..esp. for diabetics. For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!! Not happy with the product.  Once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and didnt look any thing like the product picture that was seen.  The shipping cost as much as the potatoes did! Wheres the ingredient list for this product?  Thought all foods were supposed to have it.  Would never buy any food without first knowing whats in it! Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear \"flavor\". The shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea.  If there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when I drink it. It just tastes like regular black tea.  Very disappointing. So disappointed with this frosting.  The first time I used this frosting I was disappointed, but a year has gone by and I thought that maybe I had gotten a bad container.  I really should have thought twice about buying it again, but I wanted to give Pillsbury the benefit of the doubt.  Boy was I wrong in doing that.  Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much sagged off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!  This product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting, the recipe needs tweaked, or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together.  Shame on me for trying it a second time! This was very pricey for what is essentially a small bag of hard crumbs.Maybe my dog is just spoiled, but she treats these like third class treats- it is definitely on the bottom of the doggie treat hierarchy.  More often than not, she will simply walk away from these.  Glad other people like them, but I will not be buying them again. I ATE BEER NUTS ALL THROUGH MY CHILDHOOD YEARS AND INTO MY 20S. AFTER THAT YOU COULDNT BUY THEM IN UPSTATE NY. WHEN A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE SAID HE WAS LOOKING FOR THEM, I CHECKED OUT THE NET TO FIND THEM ON YOUR SITE.THEY ARE HORRIBLE. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT. THEY TASTE MORE LIKE SPANISH PEANUTS WITH OUT THE SALT. THE BEER NUTS I REMEMBER WHERE SWEET AND SALTY, JUST LIKE THE LABEL SAYS. THESE PEANUTS ARE BLAND, BLAND, BLAND. The flavor of the old Beer Nuts is almost entirely gone. The Beer Nuts are now just plain Spanish Peanuts with a slight flavor, hardly noticeable. Extremely disappointing. It is not the best way to buy Beer Nuts.Perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a \"whole lot of shaking\".  Most of the \"coating\" and \"flavoring\" was off of the nuts.  Even though the individual cans are \"sealed\", it is like the nuts had been sitting out in a bowl for a long time on a hot, humid day. The current product, \"Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador, sold by SAAQIN\", is of terrible quality. Somehow, reviews for a similar item, produced by \"Alive and Aware\", were associated with this product. The cocoa I received when ordering through this page is made by \"Organic Herbal Essence\". Alive and Aware is delicious; Organic Herbal Essence is not. Another warning: After receiving the 5lb bag of Organic Herbal Essence and hating it, I ordered \"Alive and Aware Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador - 2 Pounds\", shipped by Halaleveryday. I thought for sure Id get Alive and Aware, given its in the product title, but Halaleveryday actually shipped me \"Organic Herbal Essence\". Grr. As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.I am really confused/irritated how my review for \"alive and aware raw cacao\" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, cant they just say \"out of stock\" or \"currently unavailable\" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.I did recently order alive and awares raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the \"brands\" and \"vendors\" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said \"alive and aware\" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, Im going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food \"of the Gods\" (theobroma) as they say :)My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so its not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know its not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after thats thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so its kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and youll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You! This product, described as organic raw cacao powder from Peru, is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder I have had.  The taste of this product is definitely not as good -- this product has a bitter, muddy, thin taste as compared to the fuller, richer taste of the real thing from other vendors.  As soon as I tasted this product, which is destined for the trash bag, I understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors -- it is nowhere near as good.  Spend a few dollars more and get the real thing. I bought this for my husband since he loves Ranch. He uses ranch dressing with everything. Before I bought it, I read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat-free... Well, my husband had it and says its aweful. I guess \"to each his own\" everyones tastebuds are not alike.  Someone else may like it, so I am not going to discourage anyone from trying it. However, I had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes Ranch in the family, doesnt like this one. I guess he needs the fat:) This was my favorite stevia product and I had it on subscribe and save until I queried customer service about NuNaturals GMO use.  Yes, NuNaturals uses GMO products.  SO, Ive canceled my subscribe and save order and am now using <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL3U0\">Stevita Stevia Clear Liquid Extract, 3.3-Ounce Container (Pack of 3)</a>. I bought this 4 pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays. The other night I decided to go ahead and use one for some dip. It was so bad I couldnt believe it. It wasnt spoiled, it just had an odd flavor with a terrible aftertaste. It didnt even taste like caviar. I threw the jar away. I ordered this for gifts around Christmas time. I actually was hoping to use it for our Christmas day meal. Two out of the four jars I ordered were rotten and inedible. I never did get to try it and I was very annoyed and disappointed! I would never have ordered this had I known I was only going to be sent 12, and one of them was open and leaking powdered spice out. I complained to Amazon, and I know from experience that they always have awesome customer service. Since I just got my package today and just opened it now, I have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issue...will keep you updated. I just wanted you guys to know that even though it states 144 packets, it is NOT. Must be a misprint? Double check with Amazon before you order this. What sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only 12 of them. i found this product doing a search for \"edible gold leaf.\" i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it. HOWEVER.. it is clearly marked \"NOT to be consumed\" and \"for decorative use only.\" so this is a misleading product. Me and my wife have tried a wide range of the Hormel compleats, and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch. I could complain about the lack of \"Chicken\" but the horrid taste evenovershadows that minor drawback. I know its a cheap meal,  but I do expect something at least a little edible.  If you are looking to the Compleats then go with something at least worth you money, pick up the far superior tasting Spaghetti or Turkey dinners, and feed this thing to the family dog. I read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy, decent tasting cup of noodles. Needless to say I found this not to be true. First, the consistency is gross and second, the taste is awful. Maybe I am just not accustomed to eating crap. Think twice before ordering this product. I wish I did. This coffee supposedly is premium, it tastes watery--very thin.  Not good at all.  Maybe old??Not sure, it was a waste, and Im using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rained-on luggage, to absorb the smells.  So I used it, but not to drink.  Do not buy. I never got the product and complained about the non receipt.  so i bought some in the store. klefje lskejfewl lsfjewldf This coffee is absolutely horrendous.  I cannot believe it has any favorable reviews and agree with the other reviewer who believes positive reviews were written by employees.  I cannot stress enough how bad this coffee is.  It doesnt even taste like coffee.  The best way to describe it is a cup of chemicals.  I am really bummed I cannot returned this.  A complete waste of money.  It all went in the garbage. The flavor of these pods is horrid.  I ordered them only because Senseo was out of stock for so long, and I needed some decaf pods, and these had received a couple good reviews (which I now suspect were written by Baronet employees).  I have never tasted such awful coffee before. A big \"YUK\" for Baronet. how come you sent me instant choc.fudge pudding...the order told you to send me the COOK & SERVE choc.fudge pudding....you show the picture of it....why couldnt send it to me....it makes me wonder if I should order anything else from you....pissed I tried the Martha White Turtle Fudge Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies I have ever made. Either there is someone on the staff of Martha White who has a lopsided sense of humor OR their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation. I wasted my time, a lot of money on chocolate and pecans,and my effort.Martha White either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies. My husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage. I bought these for my son to take to work for lunch. Apparently his co-workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again. Maybe it was a bad batch... I tried these as I love Thai food, ginger and coconut. That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesnt. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess. Found this product for sale on vacation in North Carolina and loved it... great maple flavor!! Walmart sold it for 3.99$ for the 24oz pack. Wish i would have bought some more while I was there because im not paying 15$ for what Walmart can sell for 4$. That is just robbery... very disappointed in @#@zon for their insanely high price... If price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher!! I read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup.They will not touch it. Even if I mix it with home cooked food.They like the dollar store dog food better than this.Amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name. Purchased the 0.8oz bag (Seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased), but didnt realize it was 0.8 ounces as compared to other bags.  Just be aware - might be perfect for some, but not for us.  Having a bag with 10 potato chips in it doesnt cut it for me.  Might be perfect for kids - but just a heads up. I dont know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting. Only the original flavor tasted good, so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. Pirates Booty makes popped chips that are way better. Two words: potato flakes. Not sure what the buzz about these is. Try one bag before you buy a case. Cant be returned. I bought those chips after reading good reviews but I was very disappointed with the taste. It was nothing like what I expected (granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips). I bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for. It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future. Pop Chips are basically a horribly over-priced version of \"Munchos\" which are baked potato chips and have been around forever. Period. I bought these chips thinking that they are \"all natural\" per their description of \"No preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors.\"  When I received them I checked the ingredients, and they contain \"yeast extract,\" which is synonymous with MSG (yeast extract contains processed free glutamic acid).  I will never purchase this product again. I was at a charity fund raising event where they were handing these out. They seemed pretty tasty, so I bought a couple bags at Target. The ones I bought (Barbeque and Salt and Vinegar) were AWFUL! I ended up throwing away most of them, neither I nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down. The ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling. Dont waste your money. These chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco, for $2, you can get a big bag with 10 times the amount of chips compare to these 0.8oz bag chips, so for $5 in safeway, you can get $30 worth of popchips, these bags are so tiny, its like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something, for me, i never gain weigh, i rather go buy big bag of chips, these are expensive ripoff chips, will never buy again.Maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon.com, maybe elsewhere is cheaper, but chips as junk food, shouldnt be that expensive compare to local stores. These chips arrived in terrible condition. The box they were sent in was a display box with all the usual perforations on the box for display. Why someone would send a box like that in the mail and not have put it in another real box is beyond me. The box we received was heavily taped to keep it together since the box came open on the display perforations and looked like someone had driven over the box as well, which gives you an idea of the shape of the box. The chip bags inside were pretty flat, there were no chips, but plenty of crumbs for any use you would need crumbs for. This is how many of the packages looked, flat. There were a few with edible chips, but not many. Not sure what to think of shipping chips in this type of a box, common sense should have been used?? Despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open, I was confident I knew the secret so would be fine. Not so. No matter what I did, couldnt pop off the clear plastic lid. Instructions showed the bottom part screwing off, didnt. Husband couldnt even do it and he opens everything for me. He finally got it open, only held about half of the aspargus which is what I wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from Progresso that we both can open. Note to self, pay MORE attention to what people are saying. I rarely write reviews, but these pods are so awful, I was hoping to save even one person from wasting their money like I did.  The little green plug barely stays in -- even after twisting it -- so the water is always sloshing out.  And the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design.  It is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when I tried to open one of the pods.  (And I can attest that those plastic shards are sharp!)  If you are able to actually open the pod, be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom.  Even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs (which they dont really do), they would not be worth the aggravation or cost.  Like another reviewer said, just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top.  Works perfectly and costs nothing.  Please dont waste your money on this! Ive been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb/vegetable/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly, the plastic plug at the back does NOT hold. A good idea, a nice-looking product, but poorly executed. Refrain from purchasing -- plastic bags are MUCH, much better. I threw this away after about a week of ownership.  Couldnt get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over, and half the time, I couldnt get it off at all.  It only works for long stemmed herbs, and all need to be about the same height. After I enptied the can, I noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be corroded. Of course I was afraid to eat the fruit, so I threw it away. I am waiting for a response from Native Forest to ascertain the type of metal can and if it is harmful. One would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic, they would use safe canning. I will post an addendum w/ their response. After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. Im all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health! This product was a complete disappointment. Tastes like mushy pineapple. There was no papaya taste. I will never buy this item again!! I was addicted to it until the last order!! Fruits had foul smell, tasted rotten!! Was the expiration dates forged!? Ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid.  Read the ingredients.  The main label says olive juice by no such thing.  I am going to suggest that Amazon take this off the website. I have had the regular Donut House coffee before and enjoyed it, but I had never had the flavored kind.  I was looking for a sampler pack to so my roommate and I could try the flavors as well as get some of the regular stuff.  I dont drink decaf, so I knew that some of this pack would not be used.  I figured that the rest of the cups would make up for the loss on the decaf.  I was wrong.  This \"Sampler\" pack was a joke.  18 of the cups were decaf, and 15 of them were the standard house brew.  I got 1 cup of Chocolate Glazed Donut and 1 cup of Cinnamon Roll.  Now, I will not be using most of the K-cups in this package because it was, again, MOSTLY DECAF!!!!!  This is what they consider a sample pack:8 Donut House Regular9 Donut House Decaf7 Donut Shop Regular9 Donut Shop Decaf1 Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut1 Donut House Cinnamon RollSome sample..... My husband just bought a Keurig coffe maker. In the box was samples, his favorite was Donut Shop. I ordered the 35 K-Cup for him. I was so disappointed, out of the 35 k-cups 11 were decaf, giving me 6 k-cups of each of the 4 flavors.I also ordered the Wolfgang Puck sampler, I got 12 flavors 4 each. How cool is that!I would order Donut Shop again, just not the sampler. I ordered this because I have had the Donut Shop coffee before and really enjoyed it and wanted to taste some of the other flavors they offered.  After receiving my order of the \"sampler\" pack, I was very disappointed! Over half my order was decaf coffee and I only got 2 cups of the flavored coffee; which was the main reason I ordered it.  I love this coffee but am disappointed in the so called sampler pack or \"the lack of variety\" pack! I used to buy Bobs Red Mill Organic 7 Grain Pancake & Waffle, Whole Grain Mix until I saw all these rave reviews about StoneWall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle mix. I decided to order from Amazon and tried it this morning.This pancake mix is very fine and powdery. When I made my pancake mix, the mix was all over my kitchen floor. The mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing. The waffle recipe from the label asks for 2 Tbsp. of melted butter, which I never use that much when I use the Robs Red Mill pancake mix. I could only make two perfect 7\" round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 3-4 pancakes. The pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review. However, I also tasted a lot of chemicals in it. I guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient. Looking at the ingredient label did I realize it has more chemicals than other brands. And I do not understand what ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like Cinnamon and Apple, etc.In short, I am going back to my Robs Red Mill brand, at least I know what I am digesting in my stomach. I have an immense love for pancakes.  I have been on a search for the best pancake mix for about a year. I did not write this review prematurely as I wanted to give the product a fair chance.  I tried it with whole milk.  I tried it with buttermilk. I tried it with blueberries. I tried it without blueberries.  It is by far the WORST mix I have tried thus far.  The flavor is not good, seems like it needs more sugar.  With blueberries, it is very hard to get the pancakes to cook all the way through without overcooking them.  I really am telling you all the hype on this product has got to be from people that either work for the company lol or have never tried another high quality mix.  I honestly would rather eat pancakes from McDonalds.  Dont waste your money!  (Robbys mix is also wayyyyyyyyyy better and I believe it was cheaper). (may be better for waffles...since Im stuck with two cans I may try that...ugh!) This expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake.  A less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste, no doubt.  Its a yucky product. Part of me wants to ask for a refund. I bought this package of k cups because I wanted a mix of teas. When I got my package I was very disappointed to see hardly any teas in the package. I know they substituted based on availability but I think its completely misleading to substitutes with products that dont pertain to the packaged theme. I got a mix of gingerbread and eggnog. DISAPPOINTING! This is NOT A SUMMER SAMPLERThe majority of this Sampler was hot, including: Hot Eggnog, Hot Apple Cider, Hot Gingerbread Coffee, Hot Caramel Apple, and Golden French Toast CoffeeSound like \"the Perfect Brewed Over Ice K-Cup\" to you?  This was the totality of iced drinks: Vanilla Iced Coffee, Peach Iced Tea, and unsweetened black iced tea.Additionally, there were only 8 varieties rather than the 9 listed on the description.I literally thought they might have mixed my Summer drinks for Holiday drinks, but it was clearly labeled Summer Sampler.Even worse, this item does not generally qualify for a refund.  Beware! Thought I was ordering summer tea flavors, got leftover winter garbage. I will not buy from this seller again. I HATE iced coffee, much less gingerbread and eggnog flavors! I cannot believe I just spent that amount of money on crap that I will not ever drink. Should have waited until Walmart carried it! Does Keurig know this stuff is being sold under such false advertisements? Yes, I know it says flavors may be substituted. That would be fine if they were more teas. If I had wanted gross iced coffee flavors, I would have ordered such!On the up side, the peach tea I received was very good. Otherwise, dont waste your money! I got two Teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were HOLIDAY COFFEES and APPLE CIDER!  Spicy Eggnog? Gingerbread? Bait and swtich.  The only redeeming factor - Amazon was great and issued me a refund. There should be an option for a 0 star rating because that is what I would rate this item.First, the sampling was to include 9 varieties but included only 7.  It appears that the two flavors out of stock were not substituted with two other flavors but instead a few more of the remaining flavors were tossed in the box. I had expected that when a limited edition coffee flavor such as Island Coconut was out of stock, it would be replaced with a different limited edition coffee flavor.  Same thing for the Half and Half Lemonade.Second, the order was not balanced.  Of the 7 flavors I did receive, only 2 were coffees, the remaining 5 were teas.The concept of a summer sampler set is a good one but the execution here was an epic fail.  The order is being returned today. Really Amazon?! Nothing says delicious summer treat to me like a nice cup of EGG NOG... and when I am not craving Egg Nog in the summer, its Gingerbread Id really like... dont buy this, it sucks... Im probably just going to toss it. If there was the ability to rate this with a negative number... Id say -3 I do not consider Gingerbread, Spicy Eggnog, Caramel Apple Cider, Spiced Apple Cider summer items.... You cleaned off your self at my expense!  VERY DISAPPOINTED! I ordered Ka-me rice crunch crackers, plain. I received Ka-me gluten-free rice crackers, original, all natural.  Unfortunately, they have soy products in this cracker and therefore I cant eat it.  This looks different from the picture that came with the crackers I ordered.  Apparently I cant return the box of crackers. you wont BELIEVE how many ways this product has saved my life!  I only gave it one star because im so dehydrated from drinking regular water all week because i ran out of money before my penta ran out.  when i can afford another shipment, ill jack it back up to 5 STARS!seriously, folks-- SOME waters just run through your system and you pee them all out right away.  not PENTA! it sticks to your ribs like oatmeal, restoring your bodys natural tendencies to develop sympathetic electrolytic rehydration.  but it wont weigh you down!other things i have noticed about this product:I accidentally dropped my cell phone into a glass of it, and when i pulled it out, it had better reception!I was going to discipline my kids after they tried to clean my computer with it, until i discovered that it IMPROVED its functionality!I threw some jumping beans into the bottle, and the next day i had a pair of baby pogo sticks growing in my refrigerator!hey, if you fill up your solar shower with this stuff, you wont even need soap.  it comes at a price, but its so super!If you are tired with the uninvigorating, boring old swill other people call \"water\", or are lethargic from all that unenhanced blah thats so bad they cant attach a higher market value to, and youre so over the cheap, readily available and monitored CRAP your McBurbia proffers, then look no further. The site doesnt list the ingredients for their products online.  Had I known the product was full of trans fats I would not have ordered it.  Watch your labels.  Partially hydrated = partially hydrogenated.  You have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public.  In the future I will not order a product that doesnt list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases.Did try the product and found it tasteless.  No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth, must be from the wax.  I was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead.  The sad thing is that they do NOT have to use trans fats to get flavor.  They just dont care. This flavor is awful! We absolutely love all the other flavors but goji cacao & maca is really difficult to get down. I give all the other flavors 5 stars! We have been feeding this to our dogs for over a year.  Over the past few months, we have had a problem with the cases of Grammys Pot Pie cans.  Some cans were full of chunks of fat and a thick lard-like gravy with no veggies, and some cases were fine with chicken and veggies,etc. What happened to truth in labeling?  We also had the problem with the cans being only half-full sometimes. Our dogs were getting bad diarhea from the fat in the food so we had to stop giving them Merrick.  They need to start testing their food again.  It used to be great.  Look at the old reviews from last year and before. Please think twice about purchasing this product, especially if you have a small-breed dog. I was lured by the cute, gimmicky labeling and sold by the ingredient list, but I twice fed Merrick canned food to both of my dogs, and BOTH times, BOTH dogs were diagnosed with pancreatitis -- an illness which is dangerous,  extremely painful to the animal, and which requires hospitalization. Im not sure if the fat content in those particular cans was high, or if Merrick uses an ingredient/additive that somehow sickened both of my (unrelated) dogs, but this food made them very ill. After their second hospitalization for pancreatitis, I spoke with other folks who had stopped feeding Merrick to their small-breed dogs for the same reason -- the food caused vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy in their pets. I had heard this was wonderful canned food, so I tried it for my very fussy schnauzer. I was first surprised to see a layer of fat on the top when I opened the can....I scraped that off and added a couple spoonfuls to her dry....and she sniffed it and walked away. She does seem to like the Merrick BG dry food. I chose the buffalo flavor and my girl says this is a winner. I have a special needs pet and searched for the right food.  Since Amazon has been a five star resource I chose to have Pot Pie shipped. Many of the cans are dented.  So I have to toss them or return. This is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy.  Best to purchase at the pet store, evidently. I had high hopes for this product when I first opened the package because the noodles had a great texture and the sauce looked appealing.  The food was easy to prepare at my workplace.  However to me, the taste was very oily and flavorless.  Im a big peanut satay fan and was expected more spice in the flavor. I love peanut satay.  This product is truly terrible.  In no way does it resemble that dish.  Oily, salty and tastes lousy.  Dont waste your money on this brand. I purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson.  I should have opted for real cigars, they might have tasted better. These cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew. Not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet. ordered some from an amazon-fulfilled associate. Normal amazon shipping etc...The cigars were cracked and stale. How does chewing gum shatter and break? No way it was fit for consumption.Easy return process. Ive had a lot of San Marzano tomatoes in my day, both fresh and canned, and typically they are the best tomatoes on the planet. I opened the first can from this order, and the tomatoes werent very good at all - nothing like I was used to. I later noticed that the can does not have the \"D.O.P. Certified\" label, like the photo on the Amazon page does. These tomatoes are not D.O.P. certified, and are not real San Marzano tomatoes. They are a cheap imitation.  The seller tried to mimic the label of real san marzano tomatoes so they could sell them for a higher price. I would recommend you stay away from these.  You can get better tomatoes for a fourth the price at your local grocery store. The label is misleading. Cento actually sells two kind of San Marzano with the same label other than one that says D.O.P. certified. You will receive the one w/o the D.O.P. if you order from Amazon. I have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing Cento sells ones are D.O.P and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late. The true D.O.P. ones I have to say make the best sauce! You can taste the difference. Buyer beware! The label on the Amazon site clearly states \"D.O.P Certified\" but the product received does NOT match the site label and does NOT state \"D.O.P. Certified\" This is bait and switch and I will file a complaint with Amazon. Since a DOP product is not readily available at my local grocery stores, I got really excited when I saw the photo of this product at the Amazon website because the photo states that this product is \"D.O.P. Certified.\"But when I received the shipment, it was a huge disappointment.  It was a different product than what the photo promised.  (I can buy the one that was delivered to me at my local grocery stores very easily.)  Very disappointing............. Ive used Cento San Marzano DOP certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes.That said, this is the 1st time Ive ordered this item from Amazon and ALL 12 cans arrived completely dented and banged up!Terrible presentation for an expensive item.As an aside, none of the cans I received has a \"DOP CERTIFIED\" label but only \"CERTIFIED\" and no serial # on the side of the cans so Im not sure if these tomatoes are actually DOP certified or not??? The can that is shown says D.O.P. certified but when my relative ordered them from Amazon.com, the cans that were shipped only indicate CERTIFIED. One can buy these non-DOP at any Walmart. What do they mean by CERTIFIED? Certified as to what?Unfortunately, the venders are making fools of Amazon.com. As a consequence, I am staying away from Cento products entirely. Fool me and Amazon once, shame on Cento; fool me and Amazon twice, shame on me and Amazon. There is no way I can make this review FUN! these are not DOP theyre just \"certified\" which means nothing significant. they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write \"department certified\". real dop tomatoes are much better. They tomatoes are certified San Marzano but not DOP like the item shows in picture. I called amazon and they sent me another box of 12 for free to fix issue. THe new shipment was still certified not DOP.  So please know this. Tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi. The product image is misleading. The image has the tomatoes as D.O.P. certified, but the tomatoes I received are not.... Merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise.  3/4 of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not DOP Certified.  They sent me lower standard merchandise.  Received full refund from Amazzon. Of the 12 cans shipped 11 of them had very, very serious dents in them. Im not talking dings, I talking serious dents.  So dented that I truly thought of throwing them away.  My husband stopped me though because at $5 a can he felt that it was too wasteful.  In my local grocery store, items this dented are put into a reduced price bin, because they usually dont move otherwise.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4HZ00\">Cento San Marzano Certified Tomatoes, 28-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> Its a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies! Im very disappointed when I noticed that. The same kind sold in China is even better. Do you really want to be feeding your baby a bottle of corn syrup???i used this until i realized that. i switched to gerber, its so much better for your baby. I decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy. However, this formula made him more gassy...the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby. I tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didnt work. The description of this product is disceptive.  This product was represented as a powder, but it is not a powder, its a granule.  It is nothing more than shredded coconut and doesnt even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender.Unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate-coated coconut patty, to me it is useless.  My intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake.  It ended up ruining the shake as I had to resort to chewing the undissolved, tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake.Additionally, the way the product was packaged, there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was opened.If I could have rated this product zero stars, I would have. The only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive.  I gave one package away for FREE to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible! I bought this same brand from an online Indian grocery store that usually has excellent products.  I was able to turn it into cream/butter, using my super blender and adding some water, but it barely had any flavor.  I usually buy the Chao Kah brand of coconut cream (which is quite tasty and flavorful) and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream.  My complaint is not the shreds or texture.  Mine was just virtually tasteless. I was disappointed when I received this dispenser.  It said a large dispenser.  It looks like something for a child to play with.  I bought it for my husband to put in his \"man cave\".  He is a huge M&M fan.  I buy him a tree ornament each year from the M&M collections.  I was hoping it had more substance to it.  I also did not realize I was unable to return this item. The picture shown is for three packages and the price is fair for three but I was only sent one but was charged for three. Also the item sent was not the item shown. I can buy the item shipped all day long at any local grocery store. I went to Amazon because I was looking for the type shown.When I contacted the seller and told them about this they said they would give me partial credit for the item but nothing for shipping. Seeing as how I was shipped something I didnt order I should be entitled to a full refund including shipping. I was not offered that.If I could give this seller negative stars I would. Any future buyers beware. Was shocked at the skinny size of this item!! They are five inches long as I expected, because thats the size I wanted and ordered, but cant be any bigger around than even a pencil and thats a BIG stretch!! WOW, Im sure disappointed considering the cost ~~ $7 and shipping. Wont be ordering these again.  Of course my dog likes them ok, but wouldnt call them her fav by any means. :(  Will I send them back? Dont know if its worth the hassle at this point. But I will NOT recommend them either. Because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from!  Keep looking is my advice. :)  The other Beefeaters products I ordered well met my standards. This one was a DUD!!  Whats the old saying?  Buyer beware?  I fell into that trap big time!  Heres the product link at this time:  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176AIDU\">Beefeaters Great Fillin Porkhide Rolls with Meaty Chicken Filling, 5-Inch</a>  Wish you luck if you try this product...but again \"Buyer Beware!!\"UPDATE 2.15.2012: My little dog got VERY SICK not too long after I wrote this review...I contacted Cust. Service with even more reason to not like this item and they refunded my money!! Hows that for Customer Care?? :) Great!! Thank you Amazon.com ~~ you are TERRIFIC!! If you are ordering cookies, beware, the cookies arrived in crumbles, so, if you want a box of stale crumbs order away :) Two of Aunt Gussies cookies contain 23% of daily fat allowance!  The cookies are so full of grease they fall apart.  They may be sugar free and gluten free, but they make it up with mostly FAT!  I cant even give them to my grandchildren! If you like strong coffee, as I do this coffee is over rated. I found it weak, with a sickening after  taste. Honestly, Im not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews.  Its a little weak but mostly just doesnt have a rich flavor.  It is really missing something.  I drink coffee black.  Maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar?  Before buying this coffee, I had been drinking Starbucks French Roast and Folgers Black Silk, both of which taste SO MUCH better than this coffee. Please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product! We just cancelled our subscription of 8 cases per month because the new formula is disgusting! Not buying again unless the change back to the old version! Ive had Amy and Brians coconut water - yum!, Vicos plain in the tetra pack - great! (the ones in the plastic bottle and some in the larger tetra packs are from concentrate - blah and yuck- dont get those!) , and the ones in the glass bottles- green cover- cant remember the name, but pure coconut water -great too.This, one with pineapple- no good.  The added cane juice is superfluous to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice.  It makes the water taste thicker and not so healthy.I wish these brands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients! (i.e. coconut water and pineapple juice! - no more!) Sojos diet lacks calcium, and if fed as directed will cause severe metabolic bone disease in your dog.  This diet requires supplementation with a balanced calcium/phosphorous additive to be safe. Theres one important thing not mentioned on their label and that it is NOT for use in containers! Why hide that info? To make more sales, of course. Youll only learn that if you read their Q & A on their website. I studied the labels and opened the back label and its never mentioned you cant use it on potted plants. Thanks Bayer...now I have to go back to the store to return it. I guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died, not knowing its because of this product. If you see your bees dwindle and disappear, then this is the reason. Will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers? After 3-4 years of use, they will not have a fragrance. Got earthworms? You wouldnt know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt. AVOID THIS! If I could give this product a minus 10 stars, I would.  There is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder.  This US has yet to ban this pesticide, but it has already been banned in other countries. Avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin. I gave this product a one because zero wasnt an option.  This is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it.  The only lobster in the soup was some shell.  It was salty, fishy, nasty and inedible.  Not only that, but 11 of the 12 cans were dented.  A complete waste of money.  Beyond disappointing.  It made me angry. Saw this soup in the supermarket and bought a can. Opened can. Heated soup. Tasted soup. Dumped soup down drain. Rinsed mouth with mouthwash. Enough said. This is one of the worse tasting soups Ive ever eaten. I hated it, and now I have a full case.  It tastes bitter to me, and my husband wouldnt even try it.  Only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter! This product is made in China.  I would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan/kosher.  Considering Mrs. Mays markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now were supposed to trust them making our health food?Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore. Im a little shocked that this so-called health food product is made from Chinese grown ingredients.  Id be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is.  Also keep in mind that Chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products. All the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the United States.  Why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price?  Your purchasing choice does make a difference.  Lets stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy.  They never will.  We can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well-being. Make purchase decisions wisely. Mrs. Mays should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand. I wont be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are. Do-no-harm and quality-control is a concept not understood in China. Totally frightening what theyre getting away with. I used to like this product until I learned that it is made in China!How many more horror stories do we need to hear about such atrocities as lead in baby toys made in China, contaminated baby formula made in China, contaminated tooth paste made in China, and poisoned pet food before we learn that -- if it comes from China-- it should not go in your mouth, your babys mouth, or your pets mouth??!!! I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):(1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)(2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US(3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)(4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls. I have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it. I decided to try the Stash brand instead of my normal Japanese brand, and its not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product. I strongly recommend you go with a Japanese brand that contains 100% tea ONLY.I tried to return it to Amazon, but they dont allow grocery items to be returned! I wasted a little over $15.00 because the reviews were so good.This has no taste cold or hot. It states to use 16oz of cold water.Well, I used just a cup and it didnt work out for me.I tried adding more packets and it helped but very little.I am an avid tea and coffee drinker and can only resolvethat the other reviewers have never had a good strong cupof green tea--, or I am missing something here.I do not recommend this tea. This tea is the most awful stuff Ive ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.  I tried adding sugar and it didnt help. I enjoy the Arizona Pomegranate Gree Tea and would highly recomment it. The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes. This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy. It is not iced tea. It tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves. The first ingredient in this mix, before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin.  If you suffer from a corn allergy, please do not forget to read the label & unwittingly drink this.  I have no idea why there is more maltodextrin in this product than the main product, the tea itself.  I realize this is not a review, let alone a \"helpful review\", as I did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product. I couldnt review this product, if I wanted too.  I want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea.  I didnt know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews.  I could not give the product more stars, as it contains more maltodextrin, than tea itself. I bought this tea as I like blueberries, and Stash is known as making good teas.  However, when I first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green (not very appetizing).  Once I mixed the powder with water, the resulting tea had no real flavor.  I feel like I wasted my money and cant get a refund. I wish I had read the product description better....I didn;t realize this was sweetened...I do not like the sweetened teas...now I am stuck with 2 orders of them....but the other green tea powder is great. When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I dont even know if Ill be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this. This tea was horrible.  It tasted like potpourri.  I have really enjoyed other Davidsons teas,many also containing flowers, and thought to try something new.  I think the last ingredient is where things went bad.  It was \"natural flavor\"  which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all. We purchased from the original website 8 flavored sugars all but the raspberry was worth the money the rest had little or no flavor at all! It was expensive and not worth the money. I love the popcorn, but the shipping costs are INSANE!! A total rip off. Wabash Valley Farms or Amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind. 5 Stars for the popcorn. Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like youre eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Cant you ship this product for less?Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really. This is  terrible popcorn! No taste, poor popping ratio. and the size OMG! I popped this Gourmet popping corn in front of a party, everyone busted out in laughter! Do not spend your money on this product as you will find the popping ratio extremely poor. One cup of popcorn will have 1/2 cup of  un poped (old Mades) kernels left over which is unacceptable.This is a non returnable item so if you buy this one you are just out of luck, so I recommend staying away from this one. I am so surprised that they have this popcorn for sale.  I received 6 bags the other day and the special popcorn pan from Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country ....GOURMET ... well.. the popped kernels are the size of a pea and with hulls.  It burns very easily.  There are too many old maids due to the delicate nature of the kernel.  I ended up throwing most of the popped corn away.  I am so disappointed in this product.  I now have 5.75 bags of this stuff ... I have nothing good to say about it ... but if you like tiny popped corn with lots of hulls then this may be your product.  I am giving mine to the squirrels. This popcorn has alot of hulls I order 4 bags and cant stand to eat it its so hully - terrible I ordered this because Amazon recommended it to go along with the Redenbacker popcorn popper I got from them. Hey, only a few of these actually pop! Most of these small, unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper. What an absolute waste of money! worst popcorn ive ever bought.  chewy not fluffy.  gave it to the birds for bird food.  postage was outrageous!  just not a good experience all around.  wont be buying from them ever again. This \"Baby White\" popcorn pops small and somewhat hard.  I have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat, using a \"whirlypop\" popcorn popper.  Unsatisfactory results!  I wont purchase this again. I can only go as low as 1 star on the review, though Id like to rate it a \"0\"- this item still shows in stock, but clearly isnt, which is why my order was canceled from Amazon today. Amazon suggested I search out the item again, and in doing so I see that this same vendor states the item is available. Not so.Technically this review does not relate to the quality of the product, just the ability to be able to ship it. Good luck! Bits of \"Clam?\" (not sure) in water with something I assume is potatoes. Whose recipe is this? save your money get something worth having. How do so many like this?! Its awful! If you prefer REAL Clam Chowder and not seawater with something floating in it DO NOT buy this! We opened a can of Bar Harbor clam chowder and could not believe how few clams were in the chowder.  There were mostly potatoes. Tried this yesterday as a \"treat\" on a cold, rainy fall night.  It had an unpleasant, grainy and somewhat watery texture.  The clams were actually sandy and gritty and the potatoes were kind of chalky, for lack of a better term.  The flavor was also very lacking...it didnt really taste like, well, anything.  Definitely not worth the price.  I can only imagine the people who wrote the good reviews either work for Bar Harbor or have never tried any other kind of clam chowder. One perfect box. No rips, tears or gouges. Inside the box? 6 badly dented cans of chowder that looked like they fell out of an airplane. Every single can! Very disappointed. Should I return them all? Is the chowder any good? Was this a joke? I rate this 1 star...for the unblemished box. I ordered this Pack of 20 1-pound full leaf tea which looked like a great deal. Well....1st, its not 20lbs of tea, I received only 12nd, its not high quality full leaf tea, but rather the ground tea leaves youd expect from liptonStrangely enough, I ordered the non-decaf regular version and it arrived as full leaf tea and doesnt taste half bad. If someone receives something different than I or rather if someone receives what was advertised, Id like to know about it. Maybe Ill try again. This was the 2nd time that I ordered the Smokehouse USA Chicken Stix. The 1st order had USA printed right on the bag, this one had a USA sticker over the China sticker.  In addition, the product looked entirely different. Obviously I am concerned. I pay more to ensure I am not feeding my \"fur kids\" products from China. If it happens again, Ill stop ordering all Smokehouse products on-line. According to an article on CNN.com on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the lable.\"Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., also matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount.\" I bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because I see it everywhere. It was nasty. I will never drink this crap again, I dont care how \"good\" it is for you. The taste is disgusting and Id rather just drink regular water. Blah! This stuff is pretty disgusting.  I dont care if Madonna, Tom Cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps, it tastes bad.  And as far as rehydrating better than water, umm, dont think so.  It might replenish potassium, although, unless you are participating in the Olympics, you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity. When I placed my order it was for Hartz Pigskin 10 pack with sweet potato center.  When I received the order it was Hartz Pigskin 10 packs but it was all pigskin and this is not easy for my dog to chew.  I contacted the company and they were very nice about the hole thing as they refunded the money to my credit card and told me to take the pigskin packs to a local shelter or SPCA.  They were also very fast in sending out the original product.  They told me that they forgot to change the photo from sweet potato center to all wrapped pigskin and they would do that. I emailed customer service and asked if the treats were filled with sweet potato, and they assured me that theyd checked with the manufacturer and confirmed that they did in fact have a sweet potato center.  However, the ones I received did not and I feel like I was lied to by customer service because they didnt want to take the time to actually check into it. If you love super dark, rich, bold and thick flavored coffee then this is the coffee for you...with one problem.  Personally I love coffee that embodies everything I just said.  I love esspresso and the like.  To find a K-cup that is this bold even on the 10 oz. setting is great...but there is that problem again...It smells, tastes, and leaves the after taste of burnt urine!  Like someone torched a public restroom and mopped the floor with coffee, then packaged it. Yum!There are other dark, bold k-cups out there that have a better smell, flavor and does not have a nasty after taste. You may not believe me, and that is fine, but get a sample pack before going for the 24, youll thank me later. Try the Green Mountain Coffee Extra Bold Sumatran Reserve K-Cups. Better all around cup of coffee. These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hersheys or Reeses crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these \"thin crisps\" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones. To be honest with you, I got these at a store. You think wow chocolate chips, and Oreos. Think again.For those that think these are so good, I would recommend the Hersheys or Reeses crisp wafer bars. My honest view on these \"thin crisps\" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones. These things are low cal oreos: minus the creme, minus the cookie! The title \"oreo\" is basically a total misnomer. These are nothing but black crackers with some sugar. If that is what you want, then click purchase. This comes in a case of 24 so I bought one can locally before ordering the large amount.  Good move!  I have 3 cats and none of them would eat it. This review is for the mature gourmet beef entree. Havent tried the other favors yet. I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.Theo. This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I dont really care as long as people find out whats real and can avoid my mistakes.I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.My housemate at the time was working for Hills and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesnt think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didnt work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didnt work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since Ive had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldnt just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. Its amazing. And its 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dads papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. Its incredible.I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasnt eating any real food.Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please dont feed your cat this. Its garbage. We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didnt warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldnt seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck. We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.

Figure it out for yourself, but please dont feed your cat this. Its garbage. I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cats cant digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...its cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesnt sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Dont let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hills to sell you their cat food.My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0\">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a> I did not know anything about chutney until I went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar! I thought chutney was a different form of Marmalade but I was wrong! I received this box with great anticipation since they dont sell these on the west coast. I got the package, opened the box and was EXTREMELY disappointed. The cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs. AND THERE WAS A RODENT SIZED HOLE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX!!!!!!!! So, needless to say I will not NOT be reordering these again. I was disappointed when I received this shipment, as the seaweed contains MSG, and its not listed as an ingredient.Amazon was very gracious and refunded me the amount of purchase. My local Walmart and Target both have this, ground or whole bean, at a regular price of less than $9 per 12 oz. bag. Its WAY overpriced here.It is an excellent coffee - Im drinking it as I write this: an interesting hint of woody, creamy, citrusy taste thats dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts. I tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both.  They had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange.  I threw both items away. The chocolate cake is fantastic, so I had reason to think that this would be as well - not the case.  It was very dense & tasteless - totally unlike the airy, tasty chocolate.I want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix. Reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes, I served them with a chinese Christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed, as were my guests.  Three sample fortunes are:  \"Life is not a struggle.  Its a wiggle.\"  \"Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things.\"  \"If youre feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work.\"  These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites.  A fortune is:  \"Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,\" and it doesnt matter if they are predictive or not.  What matters is that they state a fortune.  \"Beware the dog in the corner house,\" would be fun to get.  \"Life is a wiggle\" is boring.The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers.  All of that was as Id hoped.  But content counts, in fortune cookies especially. We purchased this product and were greatly disappointed.  The product did not have the texture or the taste that it should have.  We contacted customer service and when they discovered that we were complaining, they suddenly could not understand us and said customer service would contact us.  We never got a call back and could not get in touch with them again.  Very expensive and no quality.  Stay away from this company.  We lived in Spain for years and know what this product should taste like and this was not what it should have tasted like. Ive had many types of pepper jelly, and this is by far the worst ever. The price is high, and the taste is not good. The shipping was outrageous. More costly than the green pepper jelly. Dont waste you money. first off, i love whole wheat products, and flax seed so i hope we just got a bad batch (and no it wasnt expired, i checked the date) but my mom and i just had some of these and were not fans. they had an oddly fishy/grassy taste to it kind of like you might get with rancid flax oil tablets. O_o Ive been buying these for nearly 5 years and this is the fiirst time that my son has refused to eat them. They are darker green than usual, which was not a problem, but the texture was chewier and the flavor wasnt as good. This is a problem since its the only vegetable my son eats and he has severe feeding issues. The taste & texture were so different he was gagging. Not pleased with the change. Even though this item is listed under the Gluten free category, it is not.  The ingredients state that it contains wheat protein.  Do not order this if you need GF food.  Bad reviewing by Amazon! I drink 10 cups a day of Verona, Italian, or French roast coffee, and wanted to try a lower-acid version. This brand of coffee smells and tastes like vinegar. It is totally unpalatable and you are better off drinking water if the acid in coffee bothers you. This coffee tastes so nasty I cant even drink it. Its disgusting. I cant believe anything this bitter is acid free. I actually threw away two bags. Flavor may be something that has to be given up with low acid coffee, but I decided Id rather take massive doses of Pepcid and drink regular coffee than subject my tongue to this awful swill. I have made potato bread before with great results but this Hodgson bread-mix is way too dry, it needs some more moisture-dont buy it unless you want really dry bread. Three of us tried it; one of us was barely able to drink it, with ice.  I guess this is, like Evian, an \"acquired taste.\"  Unless youre able to try a single bottle before purchase, I recommend you pass. Yes the water appears clear, but once the water is heated for tea it turns the tea cloudy. Why is that, well it means it has impurities. Perhaps bacteria?? Im a Registered Nurse not a water expert, but I can tell you that I am right about the water. I can run my well water from my tap and get the same results, its awful.  I normally use Brita filters with the pitcher provided and when I heat or even boil the water the tea stays clear. This Means no bacteria have been killed off by the heating process, it means youd be better off drinking the Brita water!!!!!! I gave this bottle water a chance I got a second case and the same thing happen. I wouldnt drink this water straight from the bottle ever. As a nurse I know its not a good idea.  If you ever want to know if water is good or clear of bacteria/impurities you can make Lipton tea hot then, as it cools down IF the tea turns very cloudy it has dead bacteria and other impurities. I used the ice cubes made from this bottled water as well, so nothing is different except the tea.  Tried the Brita water and Brita made ice cubes and it remained clear.  Sorry not a good review from me I am afraid. I was very disappointed as I thought \"yeah\" a bottled water I can carry to work, so I am not force to pay $1.50 for a bottle from the machine, but it turn out not to be so.Okay, so I tried another company on this website Nestles which in my region came as Deer Park. I have never tried this brand but it is so much better it doesnt,t turn cloudy when I boil it.  So you be you own judge. Do not buy this if your thinking its only mango.  Ingredient says \"Fruit Juice Blend (Organic White Grape Juice, Organic Apple Juice And Organic Pineapple Juice From Concentrate, Organic Mango Puree.\"I cancelled order as soon as I realized this drink had grape and pineapple. Consumer Reports rated these crackers the highest in inorganic arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market. I like these crackers, but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved. Ive been eating Snows clam chowder for years, so I buy a few cans when its on sale. Well it looks like Bumble Bee has taken over. What a big mistake. When I opened the can, it was all watery and smelled funny. I put it in a bowl to microwave, and noticed how thin it was, but thought Id try it anyway. It was nasty to say the least. It about made me sick. So I went and opened another of the new cans, more of the same. Then I got an older can of the non-Bumble Bee chowder and it was great like always. If I could give the new junk no stars, I would. Sucks bad. Looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water. No chocolate flavor whatsoever, this was a complete disappointment.  I got the hot chocolate k-cups from swiss miss instead.  How people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me, is the Amazon ratings system being gamed for this product? It has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache. This should say light or diet to let the buyer know this. I would have never bought it had I known. It seems like it would taste good otherwise. When I bought my Keurig brewer, I eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker.  Im still looking.  The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found its way to the trash.  Ill find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on. I was hoping this was a good idea.  However we tried them even after I heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true.  Not the same as the stuff from the can. So if you are a person who likes swiss miss / hot cocoa packets or hot cocoa from a gas station SO DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!  I can not taste any chocolate flavor in it whatsoever.  It just tastes like heated sugar water and nasty sugar water at that.  This product has a strong fake sugar taste and I am perfectly OK with diet sodas and other fake sugar products.  There is something about this I just can not put a finger on it but it made my stomach curl.  I even waited for it to cool down, but it got worse.  Very disapointed in this product and it was not what I was expecting at all. All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior. Since I am willing to try alot of new things. I thought that I would buy this product.. And since I do like hot cocoa, I bought 2 boxes.. WORST thing I could have done.. This is bland, with very little flavour. It also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug.Personally I will not buy this product again. I will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the Keurig K-Cup Just plain nasty!!! This item tasted like cardboard, very watered down and no flavor to it at all.  Very disappointed I dont expect great hot chocolate from a k-cup, but it should at least taste like theres some cocoa in it. I cant believe how bad this stuff tastes. I tried it 3 times, and then threw the rest away. I looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa, but was very disappointed with the flavor. It has an awful aftertaste, like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. Also kind of weak, even on the smallest cup setting. So bad, I returned it. My children didnt even like it, and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food. I tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before I bought it, but couldnt find anything online. Turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists, and yet, that didnt help the taste at all. It is awful.I had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldnt find any takers. I finally got rid it of it at the Christmas White Elephant gift exchange at work. I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I havent asked him if his family enjoyed it because I dont want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hersheys cocoa and some sugar to taste. It takes about three minutes, and its delicious. Now, where did I put those mini-marshmallows? This tastes terrible...  Like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate.  The best I have tried so far is Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate K-Cups.  Dont think they are sold on Amazon yet... Cant tell you how this tastes, because I read the ingredients first, but it has trans-fats in every flavor. :( The seller should disclose all ingredients in the description. I wouldnt have purchased this otherwise. I received my order of Grove Square hot cocoa mix today, and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix. I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels. I would urge Amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale. If the ingredients had been listed, those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products. This does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use.I is just not good. When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. Im a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I cant have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. Theres just this strange taste to them that doesnt sit well on the tongue. Im not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I havent found anything that takes the taste away. Im going to give my second box to a friend, she doesnt seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so its not just me. I also took it to a friends house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didnt need to be descaled. So I guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes. I ordered this product because of a good price deal.  Amazon shipped accordingly, absolutely no problems there.  However, the taste of this product was horrendous.  It tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it.  I personally will go back to buying Swiss Miss in a can and just using the Keurig to give me Hot Water, cheaper and much better tasting. This has to be without a doubt the WORST tasting Hot Chocolate ever! The best way to describe the taste of \"This Stuff\" is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. Swiss Miss instant is way better and cost less. After only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this \"SLOP\"! I guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesnt mention that the first ingredient is trans fat (partially hydrogenated oil).  Had I know, I would not have purchased this.  Consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients. Please stay away from artificial sweetners.Some of them actually change the shape of human cells.this has an artificial sweetner Ive been excitedly trying every type of K cup I can get my hands on since I got my Keurig for christmas and, until now, have not encountered any that I truly hate. Until I discovered this one. I would have though it pretty difficult to ruin hot chocolate but the people at Grove Square certainly did a good job. Not only was the hot chocolate watery, but it had a horrible plastic aftertaste also. Yuck! I ordered this specifically b/c they said \"dark chocolate\" so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor. They taste very watery, even using the lowest amount of water on the Keurig. The nutritional fact show that it only has 6 grams of sugar - where the normal store bought powder has 22 grams. I didnt like these at all. If youre going for something low sugar, they might be for you! I ORDERED THE DARK HOT COCOA IN HOPES IT WOULD BE REAL CHOCOLATEY AND IT WAS NO BETTER THAN BUYING A POUCH OF HOT CHOCOLATE AND ADDING IT TO HOT WATER. I ACTUALLY THINK THE POUCH ADDED TO HOT WATER IS LOADS BETTER AND A WHOLE LOT CHEAPER!!!! V-E-R-Y ...D-I-A-P-P-O-I-N-T-E-D! FOR THE PRICE...ITS A RIP-OFF! this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients.NO REAL PEPPERMINT IS IN THIS PRODUCT and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either. I cant believe I didnt check out the ingredients for this.  I never would have bought it if I would have known there was artificial sweetener in it!  First cup though, I got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote.  If you dont have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems, you may like it.  Not worth it to us. We prefer the Swiss Miss brand K-cup.  This one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate. This is my least favorite of all k-cup brands. Nice price, and glad to see a subscribe & save option on k-cups. However this was undrinkable in our opinion. Didnt seem to be too watery like another reviewer said, just a bad off taste. I have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. It has such a bad aftertaste that I checked the box to see if I ordered sugarfree by mistake! I will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this, dont buy this brand. Its downright awful! I love hot chocolate and was very excited to find a variety pack, however, these are gross.  Horrible after taste, my kids dont even like them.  Now I have 3 boxes of the stuff that no one will drink.  Very disapointed. I was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my Keurig and even happier there was a variety pack.  I read the reviews and even there were some negative ones, I went with it anyways.I tried the milk chocolate.  It has such a weird taste to it.  But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds werent off. He commented that it had a \"hot plastic-y\" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste. As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I dont have a problem with artifical sweetener. Its just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone. taste nothing like how cocoa should taste, ill never touch this again, ill be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, GLUCOSE SYRUP SOLIDS, COCA (PROCESSED WITH ALKALI), PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL (MAY CONTAIN COCONUT, SOYBEAN, SUNFLOWER, PALM AND/OR CANOLA), NONFAT DRY MILK, MODIFIED WHEY, MALTODEXTRIN, SALT, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS, CELLULOSE GUM, SODIUM CASEINATE, CORNSTARCH, LACTOSE, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SUCRALOSE, MONO- AND DIGLYCERIDES, SILICON DIOXIDE, SOY LECITHIN, ARTIFICIAL COLOR.CONTAINS: MILK AND SOYPeople, please read labels.... If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isnt very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didnt have the artificial sweetener aftertaste.This has artificial sweetener (sucorse)  just like the other hot chocolates out there. I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I wont order any Grove Square products again. I bought this to include in my daughters party bag - It worked so well with the circus theme that we had.  Unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale.  When I heard this the first time I thought no way cant be but then someone else told me the same thing and then I heard it again from someone else.  Really disappointing.  I am so embarrassed. Arrives $15.06 postage due in a used Friendly s box. UNFRIENDLY dont you think? Worst service ever!!!!!_Totally unfriendly! !!!aweful aweful aweful service! Ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together.Checked the expiration date and it wasnt expired.Starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad. I dont know the deal is here but they are terrible.  I love Cracker Jacks and not just cause there is a prize, especially now that the prizes are pointless compared to what you use to get.These arrived and the first box I ate seemed very stale, checked the date and was not expired and the date was a long ways away so I figured maybe it was that box.  But Im a few boxes in now and they are all the same its like chewing on cardboard.  I event went to the local 7-11 to get some to compare and those at 7-11 were 1000 timex better.Since it was so cheap to get them its not worth the hassle to send them back so I think Ill just give them out for halloween. Cracker Jacks were horrible--stale, not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired Original description and order said \"Assorted\" chocolates. What I got--weeks (!) later--was one pack of all white chocolates (the least desirable). Not worth the bother of returning even with Prime. Might be better just buying at local store (same or cheaper price) when you can see what you get. These look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored. You would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor. They taste like cheap Kool-Aid and not the yummy Jelly Belly ones I cant seem to find on Amazon. they decided to ship both my order in ONE HUGE box of 24 cans instead of 12 green beans in one box, 12 corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house.  then every single can of green beans was dented and 3 cans of corn were dented The purchase and receipt of the box of chocolates was very good, and made my home in plenty of time for Christmas.  The box was opened the day after new years.  The cholocates were discolored and dry.  The box had expired two months before I made the order.  I made a complaint with Amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card.  This company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper.  They would not reply back to my inquiry as to who would pay for the shipping the chocolates back to the seller. I still have the out of date and bad box of cholocate and will keep them for inspection for the next month or so.  Then trash can. The box has only pasta and dried-up sauce. No TUNA!!!If you can see the words in the spoon on the bottom right of the box, it says, \"Just add tuna\".So the products is making a FALSE CLAIM !!! Shame on you, Annie. Instead of a resealable tub with the jelly beans, I received a cardboard box, with a plastic bag full of jelly beans.  They were closed with a twist tie and there was no labeling on the bag.  On the box there was a typed label that said:\"green apple jelly  belly 16 oz. new\".  There was no ingredient list, company logo, allergen information, or anything else youd expect to find on food packages. I certainly wouldnt eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie.  I did ask that it be shipped next day, so maybe they couldnt take the time to package it in the advertised tub.  Amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund, which was the only positive part of the experience. This is not a 20 oz bag.  It is only 4oz each bag.  Misleading product.  Thought I was buying 20oz bags.  Not very happy.  Shouldve gone local for 8 dollars per bag. I really wanted these to taste good, but there is something in there that is very bitter. I had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable. No one would eat them. They LOOKED delicious after baking and theyre healthy, but thats only if you manage to choke one down. I have tried their gingerbread, corn muffin mix, and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great. This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding \"something\" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much \"Doctoring\" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products. Try their Blueberry Muffin Mix and hope that one day Amazon will carry a wider array of their Gluten Free offerings as many are very, very good. I have never prepared anything so disgusting.  The taste was a mix of sour milk and cardboard, the smell just as bad.  I had to take the trash out because the whole room was beginning to smell.  I bake often, so I know its not a kitchen error and Im not that picky, but I could not stop gagging. I would recommend Pamelas brownies--add extra dark chocolate and theyre delicious as \"brownie bite\" cookies (side recipe on the bag).  I even make them super healthy and use 1/2C applesause instead of oil! I was really excited and surprised when I found this mix in my local Wal Mart. Given it was a good price, I figured Id give it a shot.... before I whipped up a batch I figured Id do a little investigating to see if there was any input/ suggestions on the mix. WOW. Is everyone using the same mix or what? Reviews from \"its great\" to \"its horrible\"..like a total 50/50 split. SOOOooo, before  I wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself, I figured Id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix, all on its own.... ummmmm, yeah. It TOTALLY has a pretty strong bitter after taste. :/ And , like another reviewer, I had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener (I dont like things very sweet, at all) but its DEF not. As I re read the ingredients I realized there isnt ANY sugar/sweetener in this mix so, youd def NEED to add sweetening. But, overall, I dont even plan on taking this mix that far. Im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away. Thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away..... Id strongly suggest avoiding this mix.... I hope the company works on this mix. It has good elements to it (I like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty) and I think it COULD be really tasty. If I could, I would give it zero stars.  I am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise (can you say hockey puck), was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added.  Save your money. I bought this because I have celiac disease and was really craving some muffins.  I am not a health nut, I just cant eat gluten.  With that said, this is nasty.  It calls for very little sugar, I figure for the health nuts, so I simply added more sugar since it said to sweeten to taste.  Even with extra sugar, it leaves an extremely bitter taste in your mouth.  I would rather pass on muffins than ever taste something like this again.  On a positive note, the muffins do stay together and look like muffins and if you try the product and dislike it, you can mail in the bottom of the box and your purchase price for a refund. I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earths Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they werent anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.  Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them. These cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - I didnt realize until I tried one, and ended up with a little bit of a headache, which made me check the ingredient list - it isnt noted on the front of the box.  They definitely have an artificial taste, I would not buy them again. This Hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa Ive ever had. I know its not going to taste like the real thing, but after just three cups I cant bring myself to finishing the box. I think Ill just throw them out. Our k-cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors weve tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa. The first try was very watery so I thought the cup size needs to be reduced. This results in just a sweeter cup of hot water. Stick with coffee. This product tastes like muddy water maybe because it is out of date!?!  I dont know but Ill not buy this again. After trying several of these k-cups, we threw the rest of the box away.  It only ever created flavorless brown water.  We then tried the Grove Square dark chocolate cocoa k-cups, and were much happier. This one has a major problem. Its waaaay too watery, even at the recommended settings. The chocolate flavor is okay, and its not overly sweet (although it still isnt great dark chocolate flavor). The really issue is that there isnt any creaminess, and adding milk only dilutes the flavor even more. Blech! Ill pass, and Im throwing the rest of the box out. Just got a new keurig and immediately went on a search forthe best dark rich bold coffee (Caribou Mahogany) and other brandswith rich taste (Wolfgang is winning so far) but really wanted to findthe best hot cocoas and got these first...now trying to give them away.The are even worse than the packaged kind you get in the stores. Actually,I think Ive found better instant ones. I hate to write a bad review but..ifyou want to find a DELICIOUS cocoa mix in the K-cups...get the Grove (Station) brandhere on Amazon.  They are always sold out (which DUH I know why now as they are a far bettertasting brand) but ifyou put your email on a wait list, theyll let you know when they come in andyou dont have to wait very long.  Id stock up though, as youll find you want a cupor two every night! (and the dark, milk and peppermint combined box is the bomb!!)I justsent a couple boxes out to a friend of mine who was complaining about how bad the k cup hotchocolates were....shell be thrilled to get my care package!! Gross! I tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes.  The flavor is all fake sweetener (odd since sucralose is the last ingredient) and no dark chocolate.  I am bummed because now I have a box of these cups and dont want to drink them. I was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews, I took a chance.  Well, no one in the family likes this stuff- it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce- more like what it says it is- Chili Sauce.  Now Im stuck with two huge bottles.  Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters. I went to check out and found out that the freight is $14.00 on an $11.00 (canned, not fresh produce)??!!  RIDICULOUS!! My husband didnt care for this coffee at all.  He complained it lacked flavor and aroma. This coffee .<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0508Y\">Melitta One:One Java Pods,Breakfast Blend Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)</a> is terrible. Cheap beans, bad roast, whatever, my lot actually tastes like it is moldy. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I have tried the Buzzworthy dark roast Melitta Pods and they are drinkable, even though I prefer medium roast coffees. Suggest you try one box of these, not the 4 box lot Im stuck with. Also, to help you evaluate this response better, you should know that I like quality roast Kenya AA or Sumatra or Columbian Supremo, etc. rich flavor type coffees. I dont like Folgers, Maxwell House, pedestrian type blends, but even those are way better than this coffee. I can get it at Walmart for $1.78 each or the gas station for $3.50 for 2. Why, just why? Im flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that \"truffle oil\" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of \"truffle oil\" are made in a laboratory. Theres not a molecule of actual truffle in them. Its a sinful shame thats perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called \"Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles.\" Read it and weep: [...]And if you see \"truffle oil\" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if theyre using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes... Tried these the other day because of the low price and regreted it from the moment the jar was opened. These sausages tasted like card board soaked in beef flavored vinegar. Im used to eating Glaziers pickled sausages that snap when you bite them. Guess I will stick to what I like. While I gave it the benefit of the doubt confirmation was ascertained on the second bite that it tastes like vomit. I will never understand the soaps from mainstream, and sometimes otherwise great brands, who claim to have a line of \"sensitive skin\" products which still contain Sodium Lauryl or Laureth (as in this case) Sulfate. If youre someone who needs sensitive skin products theres a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without SLS. Boo. Refer to their bar soap, which is wonderful. This product gave me a horrible rash.  It contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens.  They need to list allergens. I dont enjoy giving products a bad review but I was so disappointed I had to.  Ive tried quite a few teas and Ive been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so I can get down some pretty harsh teas.  I usually dont use any type of sweeteners either because I drink my tea right before bed.  Ive tried to give this tea a chance.  Ive tried it with sugar, honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk.  To me, this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too.  Ive also tried straight chamomile teas before too so I know its not that.  I would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea.  I havent tried any other Twinings products so this review is strictly for this product. It saddens me to say I had to return this item.  The items page specifically said the Calamares were packed in Olive Oil.  However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be not returnable.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.  They are the best. I did not know that I was ordering biscuit crumbs. That is exactly what I received. Such a lousy product. Its Amazons fault for shipping out expires products. Will NEVER order food from Amazon.com ever. When I eat junk food, Id like to enjoy it, the guilty pleasure it is.These cookies are neither healthy or tasty.  Stick to Chewy Chocolate Chip cookies. tastes pretty crappy. its like raw cookies.its not even like a cookie. its a squishy thing in a cookie shape After eating TANGs chocolate and double-chocolate cookies, all other cookies will taste like expired, tepid dogfood to you. Her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never dreamed possible. Tim Hortons, Timothys, Second Cup, Starbucks, Treats and those horrid packaged cookies at Zupas are just pathetic imitators to the grandeur that is a TANG cookie. HER COOKIES ARE DA BOMB!!! A+++++++ Hawt damn! Overall I was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies. They were way to fragile and crumby. There is just too many crumbs in my bed, how am I supposed to sleep like this? I have been purchasing this product for about 9 months.  The taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number. I have gotten 3 cases where the chips had no flavor at all.  Have contacted the manufacturer 2 times.  Have not received a response from my latest inquiry. I dont recommend purchasing. I bought these because I had decided I wanted to eat, and even snack, healthier.  These had so many good reviews, so I decided to try them.  I admit, it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first.  When I opened them, they looked totally unappetizing and then I tasted them......it tasted just like a rice cake/styrofoam with salt on it.  They also have a very unusual texture.  The combination of taste and texture was very disappointing.  My teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way - not even the dog would eat them.  We tried them with a variety of dips and couldnt come up with a tolerable way to choke them down.Luckily, I have a niece that is newly vegetarian, hungry all the time, and she took these off my hands.  I am still out $25 for buying the case of these to begin with...what a waste! The product that I received was not the product that was pictured and described on the items page.  The worst part of it all was that when I attempted to return the case of \"Soy Crisps\", I was unable to do so.  Amazon said that this was a non-refundable item.  So I wasted $30.00 and I am stuck with a case of \"Soy Crisps\" that I will not eat. Just plug and play with your preferred software.  No hassles, worked great for about 3 months then just stopped working.  Didnt drop it (It is made of a flimsy plastic and is light as a feather - feels cheap).  It just stopped working.  When I buy a product I dont just want it to work great for three months.  Totally dissapointed. Owned two of these and when they work they are fine.  The power knob has no indicator on it though.  My biggest problem, and the reason I will NEVER purchase another, is this: both gave out with in a year.  One now sounds like I am recording from behind a wall and one developed a hum that will not go away.  Do yourself a favor and find a more reliable option. Great audio, until a few months in it just decides to stop working. Common problem: google it and youll see. Cheapest construction of any product every designed in the entire world. Feels like a fast food toy.I do not recommend this product. Piece o garbage. This product was awesome the first couple months, I was convinced I was over any potential \"defective period...\" Well, after caring for it well and giving it no reason not to work, it of course stopped working for me. I now cant use it for anything serious. Anything I record that is profound or important runs the risk of cutting out half way without giving any warning leaving me with half a recording of audio and half with crickets. There must be some crappy design inside the tube that prevents establishing a solid connection, Im just happy its not my $100 blue microphone! Dont waste your money on the icicle, its productive ability has an expiration. Cheap: A plastic tube with some presumably lightweight circuit inside.  Never worked right; no user interface, no known way to engage or defeat the phantom power. I was told by the salesman at Guitar Center that the Icicle was easy and very high quality. . .  It is perfectly easy but I have had nothing but problems from mine. There is a constant popping in anything I record.  I am using an AKG C3000B microphone I have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic.  Anyone else having this problem? Havent been in touch with tech support yet, but I will say I am not happy with the Icicle. . . I have several different ways of connecting XLR microphones to my computers for use in webinars, and I thought this design would be simpler to transport and connect, but when I tried to use it with a Shure SM58 mic the volume it produced was about 25% of what I am used to, and was not adequate for my purpose. I had this product for literally only a week, and had only used it one time. When trying to use it again I found that it wasnt sending the sound through. When I plug it into my PC, it recognizes it and the icicle lights up, and i select it as my recording device, but then when i actually try to record, it makes no sound at all (and i have tried moving the gain knob around so its not that) This was a complete waste of money, unless theres an easy fix that im missing... this does not work on windows 7, tried reinstating software and to no surprise it dint work. This was a waste of time and money. Be aware of this issue. I have been using a standard XLR to USB cable with my Shure 58 dynamic mic, which works okay, except for an annoying hissing noise that accompanies the majority of my vocal recordings.  I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues.When I received the Icicle, I couldnt wait to plug it in and take it for a \"test\" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error - unable to load drivers.  This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasnt right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicles troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicles website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck - the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue:  \"Icicle compatibility with Windows 7\", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7.Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information.  It is nowhere in Amazons description and the Icicle \"techs\" themselves didnt have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable.  They probably have non-technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. Thats one way to save a dime, but please people - if youre going to give us \"technical support\", then say so.  If it isnt really technical support, then say it is Customer Service.I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies.  Windows 7 has been out for some time now.  There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible -it only gives set-up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS).  I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.If you have a PC that was purchased in 2011 or later, save yourself the hassle and dont bother with this product, as your OS will more than likely be Windows 7. Ill add to the growing list of reviews here regarding the Windows 7 \"USB Audio Device\" error.  I figured I had a 50% chance of it working.  It didnt.  Windows 7 insists on loading a USB driver that doesnt work.  There is a review here giving details on how to possibly circumvent this loading process, however, that did not work for me.  Its easier to return this thing, than spend my whole weekend jerking around in Windows 7 hardware manager.Blue probably has a good product here, and probably blames Windows for this issue.  However, BLUE should provide a driver that works.  Dont rely on Windows to do this.  That is corporate laziness.  Spend some resources on programming something that works for Windows 7... make it available on your support website, and make it true plug and play.  Not plug and cross-fingers, then spend hours messing around in the weeds of Windows settings.Also agree with other reviews here... in the 2 days I spent with this product... its all plastic parts, feels cheap and fragile, and the gain button is poorly thought out.Hey Blue... you had my business... then you lost me.  Im moving on to something else. purchased and it came looking new, as i had bought it NEW, but it was actually damaged.customer service with the actual company is awful--as i needed to contact the company itself to return it. Used it a couple of times over the course of a month, and it worked great! Third time, high pitched noise, and no mic signal coming through. Not too surprising, given how flimsy this thing feels. This is apparently a known issue, just look at other 1-star reviews of this product. Nuff said! I bought this before I purchased the MXL Micmate. It is plastic, and very cheaply made. I felt like it would break very easily, and would not be something that would last me a while. So then I bought the Micmate. It is solid metal, and is way better sound quality than this. I beg you to buy that over the Icicle. Buy the MXL used (Like New) from \"TheMintMovieMan\", a great seller and it is a great product. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZ8WC2\">MXL MICMATEC XLR To USB Preamp for Condenser Microphones</a> I used the icicle for about two hours. After taking a break, I plug it in and my laptop wont recognize it. I did everything I could think of to fix this, even hours of searching google. Nothing. In the process of a return. =/ It wouldve been perfect if it just worked. It works reasonably well with condenser microphones.  With dynamics the hum exceeds the signal.  Works with Windows, not with Linux.  The build is very cheap.  Anything more than $5 for this is too much. I ordered this item on March 22nd.  I expect to get its replacement from the people at Blue sometime today.  So, whats a month, anyway?  The first one that came from Amazon had a constant, high-pitched tone.  I emailed, then called Blue, and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem. He allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect.  Thats always good to hear.  So, several emails later, I received a Return Merchandise Authorization, and shipped it right back to them.  Who knows, if this one works, maybe Ill like it.  Blues products look good, but they make a strong case for buying locally. Been gluten free for 7 years now. Thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful.  We threw it away because we did not like it. For my money, you cant beat Pamelas baking mix. But, the Betty Crocker chocolate chips are the BEST! So, dont give up Betty Crocker, just work on this one! Second ingredient is SUGAR! Need I say more? Make your own bisquit mix, its super easy! I made the waffles and was not impressed.Definitely not worth the expense!Its only redeeming quality was that I seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops.I would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch. Thought I had died and gone to heaven when I made the bisquit recipe.  I was wrong! Went to indigestion hell.  I had serious hope for this product. I truley loved the mix, but it didnt love me.  I havent had indigestion since I gave up gluten until I ate a bisquit from this mix.  Best luck on getting it right bisquick. I will first say that I have only tried making pancakes with GF Bisquick. My familys experience with these pancakes, however, was very disappointing, and I will not be trying any other recipe. I have tried Betty Crockers GF Brownies, and loved them, so when I decided to spend a little extra and try GF Bisquick I was greatly let down by the result. We couldnt even finish them, we just threw them out. If you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products, I recommend trying Pamelas Pancake Mix. Otherwise, if you are looking for great GF pancakes, look elsewhere - GF Bisquick is not worth it, in our opinion. When I saw the ingredients on this box I knew it would be a disappointment. It would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix. Also, there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like Pamelas and Bobs Red Mill. This will be a huge disappointment to you so dont waste your money. Was awful. The sight of this in my pan made me sick...smells like POTATO  duh potato starch)...would not brown. My child laughed the entire time...as I complained because I was so hungry and thought I could have a late night pancake session. Totally not the case.  Yes, I am a GF newbie... I tossed the box! Pure toxic garbage. Eat poison if you want to. Toxic metals. Go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison. Look at all the high ratings. Apparently people love eating toxic metals. Not harmful? Would you eat sodium mercury phosphate? Enjoy your metals. A great idea that falls short. Bisquick gluten-free still uses an aluminum-based baking powder that is toxic to humans. Aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals. The company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this. I cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed. I actually was delighted to find this product, and my family and I loved the recipes made with it.  However it has sugar as the 2nd ingredient AND worse it has aluminum in it.  Why would I intentionally feed my family something neuro-toxic when I am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy?  I sure wish those companies who jump on the GF bandwagon would keep health in the equation.  My kids bowel movements are gluten free too, but I wouldnt serve it to them for breakfast.  Just sayin... I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.Im not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:#1) marketing it as though its an equivalent to Bisquick and#2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan GumNotice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, thats right--theres no shortening (or oil).That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they cant pretend its a safety-for-celiacs factor.  Its a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.Heres the breakdown of what youre paying $5 a pound for:rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store),sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) ,potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store),baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials),salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Mortons),xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents worth of xanthan gum.Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their \"mix\" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.I dont mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But theyre gouging us, and being misleading about the product.MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!Since theres no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vances dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you dont have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).To find the recipe, do a google search of \"betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.\"Boo on Betty Crocker. I regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy free.However, my last purchase was disappointing, after opening a brand new package I noticed a black thing in the mix, carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour beetle! I sifted the mix and found more DEAD BUGS!This is the second time I writing this review. Amazon didnt publish my first review. Thank you AMAZON.I will not be purchasing this item again. I have been Gluten Free Since 2003 and this is I think the worst tasting GF mix I have come across. I have found all to have their own pros and cons but this one have very little to brag about. I appreciate the effort anyone puts into a GF product but I couldnt buy this one again. It was like eating reconstituted potatoes that lookes like pancakes. No butter or gravy, just dehydrated spuds. The only real good thing to speak of was the texture. It was light and moist but I would have to seriously alter the recipe to add flavor. Going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease---- but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional---and definitely not recommended. I knew something was amiss when I opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand. Putting my reservations aside, I proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box. Needless to say, the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange. I would not recommmend this product for pizza dough. Bisquick GF is easy to use. Pancakes and muffins are verytasty. The product is quick and easy to use. It makes my day.  Gram These sticks definitely dont look like ones in the picture.They are much thinner and IMHO not worth the money. I should have returned it but instead gave my dog (GSD) 5 at a time to keep her busy.Id stick with the Redbarn or equivalent from another website. I just received my order of 100 count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed.\"Only ValuePetSupplies bulk Bully Sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness\". I beg to differ.The \"regular\" size is quoted as 9/16\" thickness. The product I received is less than 4/16\" in thickness.Out of 100 pieces, less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised.My blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute. It usually takes him five minutes.On the other hand, my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and wont leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up.While I understand that ValuePetSupplies.com sponsors good causes, I will be spending an extra 15 cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat. Apparently regular size = thinner than standard-sized pencils =(  My chihuahuas finish these in a matter of minutes, when it normally takes them days to consume a thicker bully stick. The ghastly horror of these pickles is enough to strip the mind of reason.  They are brown, mushy, and flavored with spices that bring to mind the morgue and the taxidermist.  On top of that each and every pickled chunk is sweetened with a full tablespoon of pure cane sugar.No living human being could consume more than one without selling his immortal soul. I have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it.  Im still able to purchase the 18oz. at my local grocery.  I was going to order this product, but saw that it was 16.5 oz. and was afraid it wouldnt go with the old Duncan Hines pound cake recipe.  Hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products. In the past I was able to make so many different cakes using this cake mix. I made 2 rum cakes today thinking I had done something wrong when the first one didnt turn out as usual. I now realize I didnt do anything wrong,Duncan Hines did something wrong by reducing the size of their product; I would gladly have paid more for the larger mix. Now I will never buy another Dunkin Hines Mix!!!!! How dumb do you think we are. Duncan Hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes. I bought them all of the time. But now they, like Betty Crocker, have downsized their packages of cake mix. These new mixes will not work with older recipes, that called for the 18.25 ounce size of cake mix. That rules out a lot of our favorite cakes. Even a plain cake will be changed - it wont bake up as high or as big in the pan. Duncan Hines just lost me as a customer.Pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes (at least, not yet). I will be buying them. If they shrink in size, I will bake from scratch. While I think this product is good, Im disappointed that they reduced the weight of the product from 18.25 oz to 16.25 oz. Has anyone else noticed how difficult it is to read the type used for the weight, the 6 looks very much like an 8.  Same size box, less product, hmmmm. Maybe, I got a bad one.  Its very plain, nothing special in flavor.  I felt like I wasted my time and money. I will not buy this flavor again. \"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.\" Be advised. You will only receive 1 (one) box. They are less than $3.00 in the local grocery store. Will not purchase again. This product was absolutely horrible!  Each and every bar was obviously old, because it was stale, smelled awful, and had to be thrown out.  Shame one you for even trying to sell such a product! Four of the eleven glass vials arrived broken. The product is apparently not able to be returned, so I just wasted 55 dollars. One of the vials was broken when we received this product... but you cant return the product or get a refund.  What a rip off. B U R N E DI read the other two reviews and didnt heed their warning. Thats on me.They are usable but they were certainly burned. I cant believe I wasted almost $20 on this. They were burned! They were inedible! It was so nasty and they took forever to arrive!You should take this product off of your product list. Worst product ive ever ordered I purchased 6 boxes as gifts at $21 per box.  I spent over $120.00 and none could be used.  Every piece was broken and could not be used for the Seder.  Sending a gift that is broken and cant be used is very embarrassing.  Also the return window is April 18th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first Seder which was on April 18th at night. This is the first time we bought this tea from Amazon, we used to get it directly from Revolution Tea. I dont know if that made any difference, or if it was just a change in the teas composition (along with the packaging), but what used to be my wifes favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste, with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong, almost cheap-generic-green-tea flavor. Really disappointing, especially since were stuck with six boxes. Trader Joes Pomegranate White tea is superior to this tea. This is very bitter and perfumey. Maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems . I found it repulsive. This was the worst tasting tea, actually the worst tasting anything, that I have ever consumed. I took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup. It tasted like dirt, which makes sense since it is a root. The rest of the tea bags are going in the trash. I also bought two of these as gifts, and will be returning them for the same reason as some of the others.  Unacceptable packaging!  Unless you have already tried the product, there is nothing about this that makes you want to try it.  I assumed (big mistake!) that there would be some kind of packaging, but there was not.  This is really sad too, because the product is great. The Ener-G English muffins that I received from Amazon were not of the same quality when I buy them directly from the distributor in Seattle.  They crumbled and had dense places that were not really edible.  Also, there were only 4 in the pack instead of 6. I had to cancel my recurring order. The Ener-G Foods English muffins look good in the packaging, but something in them makes them mushy on the bottom.  This presents a gooy feel in the mouth, and both my husband and I got stomach aches.  Wont be buying this again. If you are looking for  English muffins - go to the grocery store and buy them.  These do not even resemble English muffins and are tasteless.  However, if you are on a restricted diet (wheat flour, soy, dairy, gluten,etc.) these might be for you - check the list of ingredients.  I didnt care for them at all. These are not the greatest.  Thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come.  Not so.  They were not what I had expected. DO NOT BUY!  REVIEW ONLINE!  Looks like another treat made in China with multiple reports of suspected poisoning!!!  Please only buy treats made in the USA! DONT YOU KNOW THAT SUGAR IS THE SAND OF TIME ?  SINCE THE INGREDIENTS OF KAVLI CRISPY THIN WERE LISTED ON AMAZON, AND THE TIME I RECEIVED MY ORDER,  SUGAR  WAS ADDED TO THIS PRODUCT.  YOU ARE GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE, MISTER. Kobe beef comes from a specific prefecture in Japan and is illegal to import in to the United states. In fact, it has been illegal to import since 2010 in any form. This is just overpriced regular American beef. This food might have great contents, but my 7 1/2 lb, 11/2 yr old poodle doesnt like the taste. Shes not a picky eater. I purchased two bags of this dogfood, after one week of feeding the newman brand, my dog started vomiting after eating, she had gas all the time and lied around whimpering due to stomach ache, after having her checked for a stomach disorder, I took her off the newman dogfood and the symptoms disappeared.I have sent three emails to newman dogfood website, no replies or acknowledgement, phone number not available, the dogfood is expensive and THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTENT. I feed my dog Royal Canine brand which I typically have to mix with chicken stick or wet canned food for her to eat - I thought this stuff would be more flavorful and easy to serve.  Upon opening I could tell I made a mistake - smells like cardboard - my dog wont eat it no matter how I dress it up, much less could I get her to eat it plain.  Plus, it has none of the science behind it like higher end brands like Royal Canine - the Newman brand is spreading itself too thin here - they should stick with pasta sauce. I had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular Innova dog food. I fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced! He was going up to 10 times a day! Unbelievable! This just goes to show how much filler is in this food. Would never recommend. I have 4 dogs and all were sick on this food. One actually almost died. It had to be ressucitated. After I spent $4,000.00 on Vets bills I decided to call the FDA to analize this food. They found Ethoxyquin on it - a pesticide. [...] I just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem, that it must be known. Im still not happy about this incident. I decided not to pursue it any longer, but I still feel people should know. These Organic companies cant get away misleading people. If everyone exposed them, then this would be a better world. Think about it...<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YQMB1G\">Newmans Own Organics Chicken Rice, Advanced Dry, 25-Pound</a> Chicken MealNOT legally allowed in human foodSubject to only the less-stringent animal food safety standardsMay contain \"4-D\" chicken products:* Diseased chickens* Chickens that were Dying prior to butchering* Chickens that were Dead prior to butchering* Disabled chickens (may carry more infections)RenderedMay contain waste products* Restaurant waste* Meat processing facility waste* Packinghouse wasteNot subject to testing for quality standards or nutrient levels, may vary widely from batch to batch The number one ingredient is chicken... not organic chicken just the hormone pumped junk you wouldnt eat yourself. I will stick to Natural Balance which is sold here on Amazon as well. I will never again even CONSIDER a dog food with corn, wheat or soy in it. Grain has no place in a dogs diet! I HAVE TO SAY IN THE BEGINNING..I HAVE NOT TRIED THIS FOOD, IT HAD ME SOLD. I SAID OH BOY! ITS MADE BY PAUL NEWMAN IT \"HAS\" TO BE GOOD! THIS SHOULD \"NOT BE CATARIZED \"ORGANIC\"!! ITS DECEITFUL. IT SHOULD BE ADVERTIZED AS PARTIALLY ORGANIC! THEN YOU WONT BE UPSET THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WANT TO BE ORGANIC---THE MEAT---IS NOT! WHO CARES IF YOUR VEGGIES R ORGANIC? WELL YEH IT HELPS DEF BUT THEY DONT NORMALLY RAISE VEGGIES WITH ANTIBIOTICS ETC ETC!SO IF ORGANIC IS WHAT UR LOOKING FOR WALK UP THE AISLE TO CASTOR AND POLLUX ORGANIX DOG FOOD! EVERY SINGLE INGREDIANT \"IS\"  O  R  G  A  N  I  C  !!!SHAME ON YOU THE COMPANY OF ONE OF MY FAV ACTORS! IM TRULY SURPRISED HE LET THIS BE UNDER THE REVIEWS OF ORGANIC! Weve been feeding this food to our wheaten terrier for a year, with happy results - until last Tuesday, when my latest subscribe-and-save bag was opened: my dog started throwing up during the night after eating from this new bag. On the first night, I figured shed eaten something bad off the street. On the second night, I figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street. On the third night, I started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching, and I realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as wed started the new bag. I stopped feeding the dog the Newmans Own and the vomiting stopped for 2 nights. Last night, I fed her the food again, and sure enough, she threw up in the night.I trusted and liked this food - and all things under the Newmans Own brand - but ill never buy their products again. They clearly have a dangerous quality control problem. As other viewers have pointed out, this dog food contains pesticides and grains, among other questionable ingredients. The experience with this brand has been disappointing. I appreciate Newmans Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.\"Stacey\"s review sold me on it:\"Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with \"meat by-product\" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be \"unfit for human consumption\". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered \"waste\" and packaging it up as \"healthy & nutritious\" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not \"sold-out\" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of \"aflatoxin poisoning\" from the \"healthy & nutritious\" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as \"Natural\", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their \"high priced waste\" and heavily marketing it as \"natural\".My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesnt contain any cheap fillers, its more satisfying to your dog so you dont need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Dont wait until its too late for your beloved pet. \" The chicken is not organic. It is the MAIN ingredient. This is NOT organic dog food. It is marketing lies to fool you into thinking you are paying more for quality ingredients when you are not getting organic chicken. this gum is the worst i have ever purchased, plain and simple. within two seconds of chewing taste gone! Ive never had an allergic reaction to any food, or anything else, in my life.  But within 20 seconds of starting to chew a piece of this gum, my throat began to burn and my airway became constricted.  Thats strange, because Ive been chewing spearmint and peppermint ice cubes for a while now with no reaction.  I \"tasted\" another piece from another pack (we get this stuff free at the dining facility here in Iraq), and again, my throat started burning.  So, if you have a history of food allergies, you might not want to try this flavor. Are you kidding me! $32.00!!! I buy this all day long at popular wholesale clubs for under $10.00. No more then $15.00 at reqular stores. Watch these prices guys. I absolutely love this stuff, but I pay $2.00 to $2.50 for a 6-pack in the grocery store.  Why is this price so HIGH? You can get these SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much cheaper at wholesale clubs.I get the 24/20oz(yes 20oz!) for $11 or $12!! Its actually even cheaper then buying the bottles from the regular store! I HATED this coffee.  Im much more of a Starbucks or Peets loyalist, so maybe Im a bit spoiled.  But after reading many positive reviews of this company I decided to give it a try.  Big mistake.  I had a hard time giving it away.  It definitely tastes like chicory.  Blagk.  Bad news. I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like \"Beneful\" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. Were talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I cant believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. This tea didnt do anything, steal have issues with itching throat, ear and everything else. But I do enjoy the smell of it.. ill say it last up to a few hours and thats it. I bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache, earache, toothache. I drink multiple cups over a few days, and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect. Taste is so-so, but thats not really what matters. As every sinus sufferer knows, if eating dirt would make the pain go away, wed eat dirt. I have ordered numerous teas, potions, lotions and other remedies...BUT have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed.  The tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside.  I would have said something sooner, however...I only tried these when I had a sinus infection and the last 3 times I tried to use one...the sealed pouch was EMPTY.  BEWARE! I guess it does the job okay.  And its much cheaper than 5-Hour brand.  But the packaging it arrived in was in Spanish.  Since I dont speak or read Spanish I was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel.The item is labelled as being made in the USA but the website on the label has a .mx extension for being a Mexican company.I dont have anything against our neighbors to the south.  I just expect that when I buy something on Amazon that the labeling will be in English unless otherwise stated. Ive tried a few of the different energy shots, and found that the \"5 hour energy\" have a flowery note (lavender?) in all of their flavours.I cant say I like it. The _effect_ is ok, but the flavour is like bad/flat orange pop, and is otherwise uninspiring. I think Id prefer the more standard berry flavour of other shots vs this one. I had to be taken to the ER in an ambulance earlier, the day before yesterday. I was having seizures, near-syncope (passing out, but still being somewhat conscious), couldnt breathe, and my blood pressure was at stroke level. I felt like and thought I was dying (or maybe already) dead for about 3 hours. It was painful and horrifying. I think I figured out what it was that caused my near-death experience. It was probably the energy-shot I took 20 minutes before then. I dont usually take something like that. Someone offered it to me, and I was so tired, I didnt even look at the bottle and took it. Please, dont use these! I purchase Banh Trang Spring Rolls Skin frequently to prepare a tasty batch of fresh spring rolls, but recently I got a container with black spots mixed into the skin.  I tried to rinse them off when they were soaking but it didnt work and had to be thrown away.  At the bottom of the container, 5 skins had what looked to be tiny ants embedded within the skin.  At that point, I decided not to have fresh spring rolls at all until I purchased a fresh batch of a different brand..  When trying to find the company on the internet to write them directly, I was unable locate their company webpage, although there were many references to the Co. name Bahn Trang. I bought this brand and it was just horrible. Amazon needs to source and offer 3 Ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today. I was not impressed with these cookies when I tried them, when they first came out and the company had only one flavor. I did not care for them but I knew that something more satisfying could be had because Id tried others.I have found many great paleo cookie recipes on web sites and in paleo cookbooks that I love and they my friends, cooking students, and neighbors have really enjoyed. If youre looking for rock your taste buds paleo cookies, I suggest you check out the recipes for chocolate chip cookies and other flavors of cookies made from blanched almond flour found in The Gluten Free Almond Flour Cookbook, Make It Paleo, and on Elana Amsterdams web site. Ive been Paleo for six months, as has my partner. We both found these inedible. All four kinds (which, by the way, taste nearly the same).Im not sure what it is about them either. It seems like they would be good from the ingredients. But something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good. I kept trying them again, hoping that they would grow on me. They sure didnt. We finally tossed them.So, I would advise getting just one from a local co-op or something before you buy a whole bunch online. I sure which I had. Formula itself is great. Works wonders for a baby that spits up but WTF... why is it so expensive here? $121 for 6 12.9oz cans. Thats $20 for a 12.9oz can when you can buy a 24oz can at any store for less than $25. Almost double the price...I dont get it. I bought these bars for several years at my local co-operative grocery store, and ate them daily--they are tasty. However, the price increased nearly 100% during that time, and I noticed that, although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size, the bar within the wrapper decreased. When I stopped buying these, the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper. Thats deceptive packaging, so I refuse to buy these any more. I suspect that other shoppers likewise complained, because last month the store where I bought these stopped carrying them. This product was a big disappointment.  The picture on the box is misleading.  These bars arent chunky, the dough isnt flaky (more like cardboardy), they arent filled with pieces of fruit, and if you didnt read the label (which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that \"yogurt powder\" is added), you wouldnt have any idea you were eating yogurt at all.  The bars probably contain MSGs, with all of the \"natural flavorings,\" etc.  Whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a \"vitamin blend\" -- theres too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition, anyway.  The experience is very much like eating a long, thin fig bar -- only not as tasty.  The fig bars I buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar, but also real fruit, whole wheat, no MSGs, and no trans fats. Id rather eat one of them. I wont be purchasing this product again. Looked like a good deal, so I ordered the ground fennel, as well as 4 other spices and seasonings from this company, but was disappointed with them all. Zero flavor, not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened. The dill smelled like dried musty grass, and the onion even worse. Ended up throwing them all away...save your money, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. When I received this product it was old and dried out!  Dingo makes a good product.  I buy them all the time and my dog loves them but this supplier should pay more attention to what they ship. most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again I did not even receive the correct product, what I received were raw UNSHELLEd peanuts, but had no option to return them becuase amazon does not allow this. I attempted to contact but got no reply, do not buy from here! I would agree with the other poor ratings for Royal Oak - very poor customer service from Royal Oak. We ordered, this year, the exact same product as last year. When it arrived, the nuts were not the same product, and they would not refund or pay shipping for the return. Also, they only operate the few weeks that peanuts are in season. Otherwise, emails and phone calls are not even acknowledged. Go to Costco, and you can buy lower than this  price per oz. Currently $32 ($3 off regular $34.99)+ tax for big size = 0.83$/oz.Besides, it is more convinient to return if you kid does not like this formulaBe careful, many times some sellers over price a product, and still make the product rank in the best sellers. Be careful when odering this, because they say its a 6 pk, but you will only get a 4 pk, plus the formula goes out in 4 months.  So if you did like I did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck!  So I know I will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren, because they wont be able to eat it. If one reads this products ingredients they will find that the first ingredient is cows milk, then SUGAR (diabetic maker), then milk, again. The fourth ingredient is sunflower oil, fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars maltose and dextrin, with the seventh ingredient being, get this, tuna fish oil. They even feature vitamin D3, which is animal derived. There are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure. If we really think about what we are feeding our babies, would we use this product? I know I wouldnt. Know your food sources. These were rancid upon receipt.  Terrible.  Very little sugar if any used.  Something went wrong with these as I cant believe anyone would see this as a final product.  Both cans! I felt ripped off. The photo clearly shows two bones and the price, at $8 plus, is indicative of two. I thought I was purchasing a \"bone\" packaged as two to a pack. Walmart sells identical big smoked knuckle bones for $3.50 ea. Why doesnt the photo show one bone instead of two if they are just shipping one? It wasnt worth the hassle to return the package to make my point of protest so I am doing it here.  Beartoothjoe Is that these are 60 calories per serving, however, in all honesty, I didnt make it through a full serving.I was excited about these, they looked like a \"grown up graham cracker\".First problem was the smell. They smelled like melted plastic, and something else Id hesitate to even guess what it is, but its bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific.I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled.Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.Im glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible. Their only redeeming quality is that they are cute. Not one single member of my family will actually eat them though, so this was definitely a waste of 3$. Had I known they would be this awful, Id have just got a second bag of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007POA158\">Hi Im Skinny Sticks, Sweet Onion Multigrain, 7-Ounce</a>.Only 30 cent more than these, but MILES better in taste. Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties. Although I didnt expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup, I did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups I have tried, that is a LIGHT broth with a mix of vegetables, corn, beans chicken and Mexican spices. This soup is thick - really thick, like the thickest tomato soup youve ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich. Its also sweet, and does not taste in the least like a Mexican soup. Instead, imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables, beans and some chicken thrown in.I ended up giving it all away, and, to be fair, one of the people I gave the soup to said her husband really liked it.For a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup, try <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014EUB7I\">Campbells Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. Coconut water should not be sweetened!!! Actually \"NO SUGAR SHOULD EVER BE ADDED\" sweeting things is an american custom, which ruins the real flavor of coconut water. I lived in Jamaica for 4 years and the bahamas for 2, and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar, its natural.I will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that its more natural and unaltered. These boxed, caned and packaged coconut water are nasty, i am still yet to try a brand, one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it. It says Habenero peppers on the ingredients, but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle. Smells like molasses and soy sauce. Taste like molasses and soy sauce. Absolutely boring. Tastes too sweet, which Jerk Seasoning is not.  Walkers woods is the most authentic to taste.  This was a waste. (First of all, somebody is chasing me around and negging all my review so dont pay anyattention to those NO votes, they both arrived within minutes of posting this review.)This sickly sweetish molasses flavored thing is NOT jerk sauce, doesnt even remotelyresemble a bad facsimile. I dont know what World Harbors is thinking, cause this stuffis horrible.BTW, I like their Teriyaki sauce, but this..... its as bad as it gets. This slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it. Our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet!She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newmans Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL09S\">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a>Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newmans Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newmans Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products. Nice.Just say NO to Science Diet and Felidae Grain Free Formula. Heres the good stuff: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK8HJ0\">Newmans Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable Formula for Cats, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>(Did they really want me to post a video with this review? Would you? Then its unanimous, this review will remain video-free!) The consistency of the grain free chicken, turkey, lamb and fish formula was likebaby poop.  There was so much water in this cat food that two cats went through afull case in a short time.  I can put the water in the cat food.  It is misleadingand a poor value for the manufacturer to water down a product, call it a 13 oz canand provide nothing like I have come to know and expect from other brands the samesize. The taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the MSG.  Those who are sensitive beware.  Also, MSG addition is usually a way to fake true flavor. The packet of these seeds that I received must have been old because I dont believe even 10% of them grew. I tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass. I garden regularly (I live in Florida) so its not that I dont know how, and I even followed the instructions to the letter, but they did not grow. Look at the ingredients...it is made with Black Tea...Google Black tea and Fluoride and you will see that black tea is LOADED with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea. Fluoride is not healthy for anyone. If you want a healthy natural tea, get one that is made with white tea leaves. White tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much, much , much less fluoride than either black or green teas. We ordered the product...our dog loves them...but no one cares if its 100 degrees outside.  recieved in one big melted ball.  thought they would ship in dry ice.  If its summer or hot in your area dont order them !! BY THE TIME I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT ALL 3 PACKAGES WERE MELTED SO ALL HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN EACH BAG HAD MELTED TOGETHER I can not believe that this is actually for sale. It needs to be recalled. Sugar is absolutely unhealthy for all your pets. They do not digest/assimilate sugar like we do. Every Vet will tell you  the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list. If you do see it on the list, DO NOT BUY IT!! This is my 2nd review for this product.  The first one was supposed to be 75 words.  That would be too long for this item.  The product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous.  The package was small and light weight but I was charged $6.78 for shipping of a $4.99 item.  I have bought many items from amazon.com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand. I bought several items and the shipping was all together.  Therefore I did not know how much was charged for each item. I will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping.  Enough said. On top of the delightful aspartame, this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for Country Time Lemonade mix. THis product (which i am not allowed to return) has ingrediants of salt, spices, hydrolysed soy protein, that last item is the common industry con for adding msg to your food. Every soup on your grocers shelf contains msg, but, i digress. So, the third ingrediant is a form of MSG, further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed ... Monosodium Gludamate, ...MSG. This does not add spice to your food, it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good, when IT DOES NOT. MSG can make dogfood taste like hamburger. anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving ALPO.  Tones and Durkee (sp) do not contain MSG, I prefer Tones!I have 8 eight ounce cans of this stuff.. would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me? I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated its a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and whats up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/companys to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I dont think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!Not a good buy IMO.  I found my Konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there; unless AMAZON brings it back at a 12 count offer; otherwise to buy one at $8 and $4.99 s/h is just way over priced and highway robbery!!!! I ordered this from Amazon and they were pure liquid. Like water. I did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter. Amazon customer service, however, was awesome and gave me a full refund Bought this after reading the good reviews - not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold. I actually opened two containers to make sure it wasnt just my nose playing tricks on me. I love this brand and I am very disappointed. My baby loves this food.  At whole foods they sell the same flat for 10.99 and thats retail.  I ordered this and just received it today.  I hadnt even opened package and I could smell a rotten smell coming from box. I opened it to find jar smashed and mold everywhere! Im so disgusted and cant believe I waited over a week for this to arrive.  What a waste of my time.  The worst part is I ordered the fruit flat as well and also a broken jar and rotten mold everywhere.  I dont get how this happens the  shipping box isnt dented or damaged neither is the flat box.  So what someone packaged and sent a smashed and rotting shipment? Not a happy customer! Dont let the \"Earths Best\" name fool you .. as stated in multiple reviews here - CHECK THE INGREDIENTS!  No wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme, \"My kids will only eat Earths Best!\" .. Well thats because they are all SWEETENED, which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly.  They WILL develop a sweet tooth QUICKLY, and will start rejecting pure vegetables / other good things because of this.  There is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods.  Thats just shameful, and there is only one reason for it - so the child will eat it and only want this brand.Best advice - if you must buy pre-made food, be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient(s) and (if needed) water.  Thats it.  Dont buy a vegetable that has \"applesauce\" or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because its sweetened.Shame on Earths Best as a company.  Kudos to their marketing department for creating a name whereas consumers will automatically be drawn to them because they think its a great product based solely on the name. Google \"propylene glycol\" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) shewas surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  Theres \"pure\" and then theres \"not so much\".....from the website:  [...]Propylene GlycolA cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. In the skin and hair, propylene glycol works as a humescent, which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water. The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.Also used in:  Tyre sealant  Rubber cleaner  De-icer  Stain removers  Fabric softener  Degreaser  Paint  Adhesive  Wallpaper stripperI wrote the company about this concern and they never responded.... Received 6 bottles of concentrate from Paragon. Mixed EXACTLY to their specs., and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavors.I am truly saddened to have to encourage you to NOT purchase the Watermelon flavor.This item has be returned for a refund. I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earths Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :(I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If its in the lids, its going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earths Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesnt bother you, most of Earths Best food is tasty. Packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten. However, Amazon.com does not let me return it. This is not right!!!! I have put the pic of the food on packaging review page. Buyers should all take a look at it. I ordered this because I really like this brand and I have never had any issue with them.  My son usually like all the flavors.  I ordered this and the pears were sour/spoiled.  The other flavors my son refused to eat. I am sure there was something wrong with it.  So I am not sure what happened but I will NOT be buying these online anymore. Several broke during transit causing mold to grow over all the other jars. Jars are cheaper at Walmart. Beware of what you are being charged .... it says that its $9.99 but 911Drugstore is charing you $39.99 plus $14 in shipping. (Ive found this to be true for several other items on this site.)Im not sure if this is a misprint .... Amazon doesnt seem to think its an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item.  I disagree, and think its Amazons responisbility to get to the bottom of this. I just called up customer service and found that since October 2011, all the jars are BPA free. BUT...the jars manufactured before October,2011 are still available in the market. Usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed. So the jars with BPA lining on the lids are still floating around in the market. The consumers cannot tell the difference. So what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is BPA free or not??? This is very very disappointing from earths best. There is BPA in the lids and company claims it doesnt touch the food so its okey. Why do they even write ORGANIC 6 times around the lid? Not honest to their costumer. I wouldnt even give 1 star if l could. I have a 6.5 month old who eats #2 food all of the time. I bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste. Coincidentally, as I was thinking that as I was feeding him he started choking and gasping for air.  He couldnt breathe and I had to give him the heimlich maneuver and luckily he started crying.  VERY SCARY and those jars went right in the garbage. This food is phenomenal but WAY overpriced. I pay $7.99 a case in New York City and it is often on sale for less than $6 a case at BabiesRus in New York City. Grocery prices are obscene in NY so if I am paying less here, this is no deal. The \"reviewer from Florida\" was being extremely kind in their review.This gruel is not even fit for farm animals.  Ive lived in Hawaii mostof my life and have shopped mostly in the local health food stores-so i have hadmany many different batches of Basmati rice.  What Amazon has sent me is NOTedible in my opinion.  It is not long grained as Basmati should be and does notcook as it should - it fully cooks too soon and does not need the full amount ofwater that Basmati usually does.I am tempted to contact the FDA to see what it really is!My apologies to the \"reviewer from Florida\" - i should have listened to you andpassed on all this frustration - Amazon does not allow returns on groceries.Needless to say - i am now stuck with several pounds of inedible rice. I would never buy this cake. It looks horrible. Some of the fondant work on this sellers other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible...worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store. The flowers look like red and green blobs. How can you possibly think you should sell these to people? I LOVE green tea and green tea beverages. When I saw this on sale I was happy to try it. Once I received it and tasted it I was not so happy. First off tasted like the smell of dirty water. Best way I can describe it lol This has cane juice yet tastes like it doesnt have anything. Added calories for what no flavor? No Thanks. So yeah all in all pretty flavorless (beside the dirty water smell taste). Was a huge disappointment. Worse yet I bought 2-12 pk cases. Now I have to doctor the rest up. Maybe just buy some lemons and make them into a green tea lemonade? Oh well, I tried. Maybe its just me, but I have used this extract in my oatmeal (same amount as McCormick extracts) and I cant taste any flavor at all.  Very disappointing. In the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother, I used the WHOLE bottle and STILL didnt have a blueberry cake.  I added about half the bottle to the cake mix (white cake--NOT vanilla), and the other half to the frosting (white frosting--NOT vanilla) and it still only had a HINT of blueberry flavor.  I was completely disappointed in all the time, effort and money spent making it, and it barely tasted blueberry.  I would have thought that using the WHOLE bottle would have made a blueberry flavor.  I guess I will have to see if I can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry FLAVORED extract.  Will not be wasting my money on this again.  :( I believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches. It now has a sour after taste and my son hates it. So as soon as the delivery guy gave me the package I opened it ready to eat some gummy bears and all I got was a big goo of gummy bears. Due to the heat of the delivery truck it all melted into gel. Of course it is not refundable so now all i have is a bag a liquid-multicolored goo. thanks for making me throw away 15 dollars. Good game amazon. So think about if its summer or kinda warm, stop and wait till december. Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - dont take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.Side effects can include:*diarrhea*intestinal cramps or gripping pains*rash*severe weight lossSenna should not be used by persons with Crones disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away! I dont like the taste of this at all.  I have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic.  Cant remember exact name but think it is something like MB - is a french company and I got it in canada and by mail order after that.  It is much better to my taste.  Never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient. This is not for me. It was like eating a bowl of fat. Not my preference. Everyone is different. Personally i dont like this at all. I was really disappointed in these olives. The are very mushy and I prefer a more firm texture. Cat Coras olives are much, much better. Ive read the reviews and I agree that Yuban is absolutely the best coffee but at $100 for 12 cans comes to over $8 a can.  Thats $3 more a can than I pay at my local store.  I dont understand the high price? I have never tasted this coffee.  But when people brew it in my house, it makes my house smell like farts.  It might taste really good, but I cant get over the fart smell.  Youve been warned. WASA Crispn Light inside packaging cannot be recycled.  The crackerbread is excellent, but its inside packaging is a cellophane or type of plastic that cannot be recycled anywhere in the six states I have contacted.  Todate WASA has not revealed what the inside packaging is made of, nor where I can recycle it. I bought two kinds of Davidsons bulk teas, Darjeeling and Gunpowder Green, and I was very disappointed in the quality. They both make kind of a murky harsh tea. The Darjeeling is very light in color and has an aftertaste more like pekoe. The Gunpowder Green is weak and flat. I certainly wouldnt recommend them. I have never received anything like this from amazon before. The product was packed in an old used golf ball box(bizarre). The cans were all dented and old looking. The bowls were chipped up. I thought, oh well, maybe the soup will taste good. Wrong!Three different flavors but they were all awful, completely inedible. All of them were horribly fishy and metallic tasting, the worst canned soups I have ever tasted in my life. Poured them all out and donated the chipped bowls to charity. Complete waste of money. While the product is delicious, its annoying that the peanut butter stays on the waxy paper instead of on the product. You need a fork to scrape the peanut butter off the protective top sheet. My cats are not picky eaters, and lick their bowls clean of virtually anything i feed them (wellness, fussie cat, fancy feast, bff). I tried feeding them Tiki Cat on 2 separate occasions, and my cats threw up both times. I thought they may have gotten sick the first time from eating something off the floor, but when it happened a second time I was certain it was the Tiki Cat. Im not sure if I received a bad batch, but I will certainly never be purchasing a Tiki Cat product again. This product smells so bad that I couldnt even try to consume it.  It smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened.  The seller has a no return policy so Im out the $ I spent on this as it will go right into the garbage. I have been making wonderful homemade vanilla with a recipe that I found on line using vanilla beans purchased from Williams Sonoma. I decided to try Spicy World Vanilla Beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma.  Two vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark richly aromatic vanilla after only two months.  I used three Spicy World vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months I had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol.  I added three more beans and waited.  The results were disappointing, so I added three more vanilla beans.  You can still see through the vanilla and it doesnt have the aroma of vanilla.  I am completely disappointed with the vanilla beans from Spicy World.  They are totally worthless, a complete waste of money.  I would not recommend them or purchase anything from Spicy World. This product had pretty good reviews so I thought it would be safe to buy 4 packages, so I did. Boy am I full of regret now. Im stuck with 4 packs of these beans and I cant return any them. The moment I opened the bag, I shouldve known. It had a stale sour smell to them. But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it wont smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. Ive made vanilla salt before so I know what its supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isnt going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. Im so disappointed. I havent cooked with these seeds so I dont know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient. I know for sure though that if youre looking to make vanilla extract, vanilla sugar or vanilla salt, I HIGHLY discourage you from buying this product. Would have rated no star if available.  Beefeaters® Chicken Liver Freeze Dried Treats for Dogs, are a product of China, and irradiated \"for your protection\" according to the companys hold message.  Called Amazon.com customer service, and requested a full refund with pre-paid returned shipping.  Too bad none of this is in the product description.  Amazon CSR was very helpful, and very cooperative, postage paid shipping label received via email immediately.  Thank you, Amazon.com! Anyone see where theses are made? - I am avoiding treats from China because of all the problems lately. and I do not see a country of origin here. One star given just for possibility that some cats out there may be less (or different) picky from ours.  See my review of CAT-MAN-DOO BONITO SPRINKLES for info on several products I \"tested\" in search of a flavor/appetite enhancer, including this shrimp version and another F&S tuna treat product that was much better received by our gang of four. Im of Russian descent and have been eating buckwheat for my entire life. I live in the US and usually buy buckwheat in local Russian or Eastern European stores. This is the first (and last) time I tried American-made buckwheat. Here are things that I found. 1. It takes only 10-12 min to cook this. Normally, it takes 25-30 min. And this item is not branded as an \"instant buckwheat\" 2. It tastes quite different than \"usual\" 3. There is a strong metallic smell 4. This item is overpriced. Just go to the closest Russian or Eastern European shop and buy the same thing 4 times cheaper. This was not good. The flavor was lacking and barely came through unlike the Hint water -- which I really enjoy. I wanted this to be good and was so excited to get it but it just disappointed. The oatmeal inside the canisters was good.  However, the packaging by Amazon was terrible.  Every single can arrived dented, and several of the cans popped open.  Amazon treats products terribly... I havent ordered from Amazon in a long time, not since they sent me expired Pirates Booty, which I tossed.  I thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try.  What a  mistake.  Never again.  Customer service at Amazon leaves much to be desired, as well.  IF you get someone, theyll probably speak broken English and be very hard to understand.  Then they will not understand the problem.  Youll have to ask for a supervisor who, you hope, will speak better English.  Be prepared to wait a LONG time for a supervisor, and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor.  The supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable, not short of your SSN, before saying, \"Well, what do you want me to do?\"  \"Uh, youre customer service... Service the customer???\"  Amazon has lost my business forever. My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.  I ordered a case of it from Amazon.  the whole case arrived moldy.  Each jar popped when I opened it too, showing that it was properly sealed.  I contacted Earths Best.  They said they would look into it but would not follow up with me.  Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE: I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earths Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.  They have come to my house and written a report.  If anyone else noticed this problem please contact the USDA (1-888-674-6854).to report your claim/problem.  They will investigate the problem and the Earths Best Plant to make sure they are following regulations. My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.

It contained 3 of this variety and he liked the first one but the others, although properly sealed, were solid and moldy and stinky.One of the Turkey dinners in the flat was also improperly sealed; the lid popped. We were lucky because I just happened to check that one. Now Im so paranoid that I check all of them several times. I called Earths Best and they assured me that they havent had this problem before and that I shouldnt worry about it. Im so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer. Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!We also recently opened 5 other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten.  3 of them were completely solid and domed at the top!  We poked a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout.  Shortly after eating his last dinner of this box, my son started vomiting and refused to eat.  We have contacted the USDA about this.  If this happens to you, please same your jars so you can give them the information they need.  It may prevent other babies from getting sick.Ill never buy anything from Earths Best again! When I saw some of the Earths Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.  My children have previously enjoyed many Earths Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.  I dont know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earths Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first. My daughter thinks this tastes nasty, and I agree. She is sensitive to carrot, so I was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but doesnt contain carrot. Though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time, she wouldnt even take a full bite of this. I tasted a little bit, and I can see why. Earths Best is supposed to be one of the best baby foods, but apparently my son does not have a palate for their food.  Maybe he did not like the texture of this stuff (it looks gritty).  He normally eats anything but was very sluggish with this food...turning his head after a couple of bites. It was bad before we open them. I saw them when we got. I did open. It had some spot green color. I did not know what it was. I was very upset. Do not buy this product.

My children have previously enjoyed many Earths Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs of the tender beef spinach. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.

I bought these for my wife for her birthday, she LOVES chocolate and its a staple gift I give her. Well this year I got her these. She only ate one, and put them away. Very strange. Later I caught her putting them in the garbage. When I tried one I quickly realized why, they taste like they have no sugar in them, and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast. I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out. We had a good laugh about it. Fortunately I also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didnt ruin her birthday. 43 dollars wasted. I purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks.  It has very little coffee taste, and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate.  Similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking.I will not be purchasing this coffee again.  My suggestion to those considering a purchase . . . buy something else. I am big coffee lover.  This was some of the worst coffee I have ever had.  It smells wonderful but the taste is horrible.  I would not recommend purchasing this coffee at all. I have a One:One Coffee Pod machine and have ordered pods online before.  These looked good and sounded like high quality coffee- albeit a little pricey for 12 pods.  This was the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted!  It left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours.  Yuck!  Dont be fooled by the fancy name and packaging. It tastes like rocket fuel.  Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money when I explained how bad it was. Throwing the whole box away! You have to put a lot of sugar in  this to make it taste good. The coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup. Next time I am going for raspberry flavored coffee...cause the chocolate is like poop. YUCK. The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous.  5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $2.00 each.  Dont buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts.  You can get a case of 12 for $20 right here on Amazon. I bought this bag and found it 50% cheaper at smart and final. It was also old and and white. This was terrible! I bought it to put in the candy canisters I give to co-workers. So I didnt find out it was OLD till a co-worker informed me. I was so embarrassed. Do not buy this candy. It all ended up in the trash. Very disappointed! This candy was obviously old. Each chocolate was discolored. The Krackel krispies were not crispy and the chocolate wasnt right. Peant butter cups and Goodbars nasty, the nuts are horrible. Hersheys pulls their candy off of the shelves in the stores when it is getting old. Seller must have bought it up & sold it here last year or the year before. It has to be at least 1 or more years old. Do not buy chocolate from ZANY Values, it isnt good for you!!Im sure that if the candy were FRESH that it would have been just fine. I have re-ordered from a different vendor and will let you know if theirs is fresh (as it should be) or not. I dont know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about. I tried Ghiraradellis premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed. I love hot cocoa and hot chocolate... and have tried many different brands.GHIRADELLI is by far the worst that I have ever tasted!  I honestly dont have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa.This cocoa has an awful, stale taste... and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients.It even tastes worse than the much lower-cost brands like Swiss Miss and Nestle.If you want a REAL hot chocolate, look up MARIE BELLE.  It is thick and rich... not weirdly processed garbage like GHIRADELLI!!! I bought this product and when it arrived it was not organic.  BEWARE!  The package shown in the photo is not an organic product. My recommendation? Get a juicer and make your own, or try Odwalla. The taste was bitter, and the smell was strange and foul. The label says \"Enriched with organic lemon juice\" and that is not pure carrot juice in my book. Maybe it was the lemon I tasted, I dont know. I had about three sips and couldnt stomach it. Talk about horrible . . .I was craving carrot juice and the store was out of the brand I normally like which has what I like for ingredients: Carrot Juice.I did see before buying that it said it had Organic Lemon Juice in it when I looked at the ingredients but I figured that the makers would only add it if it didnt change the taste that much.  Well all I have to say is I taste no semblance of carrots at all.  It tasted more like drinking a bad V-8 or something.  Then after sipping a couple of ounces I now have an acid reflux feeling in my throat and chest.  I drink water with lemon pretty often and never have that happen.  So now Im wondering exactly how much lemon juice is in here.If you want carrot juice this is NOT for you.  I dont even think they should call it that . . .I dont normally do it, but I am seriously considering taking this back to the supermarket.  I also think I should write a letter to the company because it is just that ridiculously bad. I dont know how they did it - but this is by far the worst tasting carrot juice I have ever had.  I think it has to do with the long shelf life - expires in 2012, I drank it in 2010 (well I tried to drink it).  It was probably bottled in 2007 or something.YYEECCHH!! First Indiana Jones found the \"Lost Ark of the Covenant\", then the \"Mystical Stone from the Temple of Doom\", then \"The Holy Grail\" and finally the \"Palace of The Crystal Skull\"...But the loser still cant find \"The Lost Lakewood Bottle of Real, Honest 100% \"PURE CARROT Juice\" Minus Lemons\" not without \"Short Round\" anyway.I tried to leave \"no stars\" or fewer cuz, I felt and tasted the pain of other misguided customers, I spewed out my first rancid acidic taste of this clearly labeled, \"PURE CARROT\" Juice. Lakewoods knucklehead faux pas is their troglodytian approach to the label design. I can easily read \"PURE CARROT\" and \"PURE\" again, just above the illustration of \"CARROTS ONLY\" (but nada lemons), but in much smaller print at the very bottom of the label and below the CARROTS ONLY illustration (sans lemons), it mentions \"enriched with lemons\", 1% to be exact, which means 99% of their marketing team make ODonnell look constitutionally wise.Intentional or not, it aint the keenest marketing approach to \"thinking\" consumers. To paraphrase a wiser woman, \"You might want to rethink those ties.\" (LABELS in this case)~ E.Brockovich ~.  Even Juicy Juice was smart enough to clear up their ambiguously labeled products.  Todays McFly FYI and word of the day is \"PURE\", and brought to you from my sponsor, \"Merriam Webster\": PURE : unmixed with any other matter. As in Gold, Pure Gold, Jerry. (I watch tv and commercials, does it show?)For an amazing ride courtesy of the \"short bus marketing team\" see the label here:http://www.amazon.com/Lakewood-Organic-PURE-Carrot-Juice/dp/B0000ZSHAKClick on the photo and zoom in to find the 1% of Einsteinian logic or lack there of.  Finding the PURE BS or at least 99.9% requires no zoom, matter of fact arms length, like in a grocery store aisle is close enough to be misdirected.Ok Lakewood, so, think what you will about my criticism be it glib, harsh, frank, curt or possibly even unfair or totally wrong.  On the other hand, I think not but I would love to be proven wrong.  Are you game for a little challenge: Get three 3rd graders, heck even three 3 year olds and give them each 3 crayons, green, yellow and orange.  Now ask them to draw a picture for the label of juice which contains, \"carrots and lemons\" or if your brave enough for a real acid test, \"lemons and carrots.\"  All I am saying, is give 3s a chance! In a world of scams, rip-offs and misconceptions and misdirection...be honest and be excellent to one another.No hard feelings, right?Ret Hink aka Curt Frank aka bombastic sarcastic B@5t@rD I bought this molasses at a local grocery store and nowhere on the bottle does it state that it is, unsulphered. I called the company and talked to a sales rep in which he stated that it was not unsulphered. Although it does have a higher percentage of iron, Im going back to Plantation. I thought the whole figs would be softer for spreading but they are not. You have figs laying in a very sweet syrup. Ive only tried it on toast one time and it was way to sweet to eat. The figs just lay on top unspreadable. I would not buy again. Save your money. I ordered this glitter based on the fact it advertised it was edible.  I wouldnt even try to feed this to anyone let alone on a cake for children!  I read several reviews and they all said how fantastic it was so I purchased on good faith.  When it arrived I wanted to see if it had a taste...it tastes like I assume craft glitter would taste.  I packaged it to send it back but didnt. If you want a trust worthy edible glitter, stick with Wilton products. If I could give this food a zero I would. I tried it out and the dogs loved it until they all had the runs for 2 days. It was horrible, smelled bad, and I would never get it again! The chips are awesome.  I first bought them at Costco and now I cannot get them there any more.  The bags at Costco were about 3 times larger than the one I recieved from Amazon.  The arrived mostly in tiny crumbles of chips and the bags were about 1/3 full.  I wont waste my money buying them from Amazon again as the shipping is just not up to par.  If you can find the chips retail I would advise buying them that way.  Their website says that super target and Costco carries them but have not been able to find them there recently. I am constantly looking for gluten free foods that I might enjoy for health reasons, I was excited to see these in my local store. Not only need you be concerned just with the MSG and soy protein, be aware of the weight in the packages. The bags purchased stated 5.5 oz. One seemed to be much lighter than the other. When I got them home, I put them in zip lock bags to check the contents. The bag that had seemed very light compared to the others was indeed less than a third of the amount in the other bags. It was no more than a very small handful. It did not contain crushed or broken chips, it contained very few chips. This is not the time for corporations who want to succeed and grow to cheat consumers! Is this a growing trend? I find it so. These things are like eating poker chips with seasoning salt.  Theyre remarkably high in calories, too! The only other flavored coffee Ive used was Nestle Hazelnut. It too was a 5# whole bean.  I really enjoyed that one and thought I pick this one up.Where the Nestles shared flavor with the bean this one overpowers.  This one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related. I like hazelnuts and this a isnt anything like hazelnutNow I have 5# of the stuff.  My mistake!More Info:I am about 3/4 of the way through the bag.  My opinion has not changed.  Also, I would note a very inconsistent flavor.  Todays grind seems almost devoid of the flavoring.  It appears they really dont have the adding of flavoring down.  The intensity of the flavoring is all over the park. It tastes like Jack Links brand, not Wild Bills.  Even the texture is totally different from Wild Bills.  Not recommended! When the flowers showed up, they were in pretty bad shape.  I figured that water and the provided plant food would spruce them up within a few days.  Didnt happen.  They went from being dull and wilted to being dead within four days of arrival. I got this product ship one day express. Unfortunately, when it arrived and I opened it, all I saw was a big blob of melted chocolate with LITTLE macadamia nuts in the center of the holders. I only use C&H Bakers Sugar for all my baking needs and I go through it FAST with a lot of baking. I looked on Amazon to see if I could purchase it in a case for ease and cost savings. At the grocery store, one 4lb carton costs less than $5, so to get three of them, it would cost $15 or less. Here on Amazon it is $28 PLUS $12 shipping. That totals $40 for a $15 product. Yep, thats almost 3 times more expensive than if I just purchase it at the local grocery store. I love Amazon and was really shocked to see this price. This is a definite NO THANKS, I know better than to purchase this item here! Im really disappointed with the changes in quality -- its not even the same product that we used to love.  A couple of years ago, the product was consistently fantastic, but now the taste, quality of the meat, and freshness are hit or miss...and recently its all been a miss. The Jack Links 30 Jerky Strips were verrrryyyy SKINNY! Some were only about 1/8 inch wide and counted as one strip. If I had known this, I would NOT have ordered the beef jerky strips - tasty, but totally not worth the money!!!! Wow. The hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty. I could not even eat half of the stick. I have had 3 different people try them and they had the same problem. They are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth. Avoid these at all costs. First time ordering this jerky from amazon, and I highly recommend to everyone DO NOT BUY IT! It is harder than a rock. I have bought it from other sellers not amazon, and it is much better. The experation date is not for another year, but you cannot even bite it or chew it. Horrible, I think its the worst jerky ive ever bought! I dont eat beef jerky, and I wanted to buy some for a Christmas gift.  I read all of the reviews at Amazon.com and decided that Jack Links would be the best purchase.  It came nicely packaged, but there is liquid in the packaging - a lot of it.  If you turn the packaging upside down, the movement of the liquid is obvious.  So now I have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type.Three days since my original review.  Amazon cannot accept returns of food items, so it kindly replaced the beef jerky.  The replacement also has liquid in it.  Its not fat, but a liquid as described above.  This time, Im asking for a refund. I buy Jack Links Peppered Jerky every month.  I tried these as this was the first time seeing them.  Dont waste your money.  They are so tough even the kids wouldnt eat them!!  They do not taste anything like the other \"Peppered\" jerkys.  Stick with the 1 oz or the 2 oz sticks they are moist and not so much grizzle. This is the worst Jerky I have ever tasted.  It is not edible, I actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out...I kid you not.  Dont buy this product unless you are a bar owner and want your customers to guzzle beers to put out the salty fire that is created when you eat a small bite of this crap!!!  I deserve a refund for buying this dog food....oh excuse me I forgot even my dog wont eat it :-) This says 4 pack...so I assumed like other purchases that I made that it was 4 boxes each with 4 packs. Big mistake! You only get four little pouches. Who would pay over $2 for a little squirt of applesauce? Dont make the same mistake. Buy elsewhere. I honestly have to say that I just wont buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and Im sure tastes bad because my cat wont touch it.  No way, no how, wont even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  Im sure some cats must like it because its still being made, but theres other things out there much, much better than this one. Instead of a black graduation cap, a top hat was sent instead.  Not great for a graduation gift!  Also, I think any buyer should be aware that by \"Godiva 4 Pack\", they mean \"4 pieces of candy\"!  Very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least 5 pieces of candy! Definitely not worth the price!! These little taffys are expensive. I think I paid around $11 for the pound. They taste good, but man do they give me gas. After eating about 3 my stomach would be rumbling for a few hours and I would have to pass gas a lot. My girlfriend wouldnt let me eat them before bed hahaha. There was never any pain involved, just gas. I know it was these doing it because we tested it over a few different days. I wouldnt eat the taffy some days and would be fine. All it took was a few pieces and an hour late the bubble guts would start.This information may be useful since its not on amazon.

It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. Ive contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy. My cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money..it is just sitting in our cabinets.  I will donate it to a shelter... Ive eaten Claxton Farms fruit cakes for over 40 years and love them.  I thought Id be smart and order 5 one pound cakes at once as I know Id use them.  This time the quality control went out of town.  Lousy.  Absolutely disappointing.  Of the 5 loaves, one was good,  Two were so dry they crumbled rather than be cut and I ended up adding them to cake batter in cupcakes or put on ice cream as topping,  totally unable to slice.the last two loaves just the opposite, they were runny.  When taken out of the wrapper they just flopped over, again, had to use as ice cream topping or put into cake batter for cupcakes.Claxton Farm might have sold out or fired the Quality Controller.  Awful quality after all these years.  Do NOT order from Claxton as you dont know what youll get.  They lost a long time customer with me. Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950s. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored \"cake\".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasnt widely available until the mid 1970s to mid 1980s, so Im not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldnt possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash. Aweful! They arrived immediately and still were as hard as cement! The bags supposed re-sealable zipper,didnt re-seal once and maybe the large amount had something to do with it but again, I cannot believe how stale and terrible the candy inside was! Skittles are a great candy but for this product i would say do not buy it here, I have seen this same bag for $5.89 on sale and not on sale for $7.99 at some big chain stores. the candies themselves are fine and if you are thinking of getting a big bag you know what they taste like just dont overspend to get a big bag (price wise might be cheaper to buy a bunch of little bags) ... get this type of sugar any other way than through ordering it because the shipping is INSANE!  The sugar is fine but for the price of the shipping, it was not worth it. I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless its organic. Real \"premium\" dog foods brag that theyve no corn.Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real \"premium\" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since its not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because its cheap, but its not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real \"premium\" dog foods do not have.In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Dont be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the companys 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products! I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nanas also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product. Like other reviewers, I rarely eat cookies because I have an anaphylactic response to wheat/gluten. Therefore I generally love any cookies Im not allergic to. These are an exception. The taste is mild and fleeting. The texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth. The only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting, because they are simply inedible. Blah. I purchased these because they do not contain dairy, soy or corn.  Well, in addition to being dairy free, soy free.... they are FLAVOR FREE!  Absolutely horrible dry tasting bars.  First words out of my mouth were \"tastes like dirt\" so thats what Im going with.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. These are so gross I cant believe I wasted my money on them. They gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial-smelling fragrance. I am NOT that picky an eater and I generally love any GF cookie just b/c I am so grateful they exist. But OMG I immediately spit this out AND rinsed out my mouth! Even my snack-loving toddler didnt like these. Eating them, that is. She did have a great time massaging it into a fine powder which takes almost no effort at all. What a mess. And what a waste of money. We have a gluten free household of 5.  No one in our family likes these.  My children (9, 7, &5) are begging me to throw the box away - I think they are afraid Ill sneak one in their lunchbox.  The cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth.  Have a glass of water nearby if you try these.  I hate to leave a bad review, but there are way better gluten free options out there.(I wont throw the box away.  Ill pass it on to another gluten free family I know and let them form their own opinion.) I was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of Nanas Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars. To me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder cant even cover up. I threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar. i have enjoyed this product for quite some time.  however, i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing!  at $35 per case, customers are paying more than $4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous!  i will find a healthier, more reasonably priced snack to munch on. shame on nana and amazon. . . Its Crunchy, Im now love the smoother Nanas Like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FNEX8C\">Nanas No Gluten Lemon Cookie, 3.5-Ounce Cookies (Pack of 12)</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FNEX8M\">Nanas No Gluten Chocolate Cookie, 3.5-Ounces (Pack of 12)</a> you get the idea I hope!!I dont have coffee or Chocolate anymore!If you dont have a problem GREAT but I found out I do!! I know what youre probably thinking: Theyre vegan, theyre gluten-free...theyre a dream come true! The taste of these bars is very banana-ybut I doubt youll be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that. The texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt (Im no dirt-eating pro...but when I was trying to chew thats all I kept thinking). Please...if youre thinking about trying these...go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first...while youre at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk...and lots of it!PSIf youre in the market for a yummy vegan bar...try the Betty Lous brand...The strawberry is super good! I bought a box, waistd my $$ but people love me that I could give them this!!!AFTER having a bough of HAVING to rush to bathroom I re-read the posts!

Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten! It is NOT gluten free! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering. These cookies are not worth it.For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free, please keep these facts in mind:1. If you eat gluten, it damages your intestinal lining.2. If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms.3. If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption, increase your risk for intestinal cancer, and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility, autoimmune disorders, oteoporosis.In other words, cheating on your diet is not worth it!Dont eat Nanas products!Instead, I suggest you buy something like Pamelas chunky chocolate cookies. They are one of my favorites. I dont think Ive ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars, ever in my life. They taste okay, but I just cant choke them down, even with coffee.

However, when they came we were disappointed!  The were were very old and hard...  We only opened one and it broke into pieces. Because its a food item, you cant return which I think is ridiculous...we couldnt even eat them! I order lots of stuff from Amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups. Dont buy food from Amazon! (The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to click on something and they did arrive on time). The item shipped in an unsealed plastic bag within a brown cardboard shipping sleeve. Arrived with product loose and falling out of the cardboard.  No effort had been made to seal the plastic bag or the shipping sleeve. Unbelievable.The product itself is very foul tasting with a horrible lingering aftertaste. Could be the coating?I am very disappointed in the purchase and would never buy again. Especially from this vendor. Stay away from these! We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight weve noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we dont get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One. I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like \"Beneful\" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. Were talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I cant believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. Disappointed.  The big boxes had a very different flavor than the smaller boxes.  I am not sure why but not good. We recently purchased the K-Cup machine and I was quite excited as I drink iced tea rather than coffee. This blend of black tea is quite bitter and not at all what I was looking for. It works as advertised, just not the right tea for me. the product was hard as a rock. i could not even break it in half. both dogs had hard time chewing them. puppy could not either will not get product again. unless the two packages i got were old and dried out. We have a year old pug who will eat just about anything but these!  Unfortunately he just would not go near them no matter how hard we tried to peak his interest. I had high hopes for this product, because it is healthy and affordable.  But neither of my 2 Chihuahuas liked it; one just sniffed at it and walked away; the other dog chewed on it for a short while and then walked away from it.  One dog likes <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KUO2XS\">Nylabone Nutri Dent Original Minichews for Mini Dogs, 72-Count Pouch</a>, and the other dog likes <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B3W4N8\">6\" BULLY STICKS - Free Range Standard Regular Thick Select 6 inch (10 Pack), by Downtown Pet Supply</a>.  I was looking for some alternatives that were healthy and more affordable.  I guess Ill be sticking with their current treats for now. I didnt like this carbonated juice.  Although it appears to be all juice (not artificial flavors) it tastes somewhat artificial.  Perhaps it tastes more like canned orange juice (which tastes NOTHING like REAL orange juice)!  I fully expected to like this as I do like fizzy fruit juice drinks.  This one did not do it for me. Yeah its gluten free and whatever, but unless thats a really big issue for you and youre having trouble finding sugary drinks to enjoy on your gluten-free diet, theres no real draw to this drink over say, orange fanta or any number of other carbonated juice type drinks. I thought it was massively overly sweet, and I have something of a sweet tooth. The orange flavor wasnt particularly authentic or delicious, and it left a sour aftertaste. I got a free sample this time, and I cannot see actually paying money to buy this product again. On an environmental note, packaging and shipping these things in tiny little cans makes for more waste, and I dont appreciate that either. Not a fan. It is a good thing the can is so small. The product is several cuts below Sunny Delight. Terrible! In proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content, but I would prefer a regular soda than this stuff. There is a slight citrus taste, but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards.Soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing, pleasant, and nice refreshment, but none of these traits are in this drink.I would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone I liked for any occasion, but would consider giving it to people I really didnt care for to see their reaction.Avoid this one. Orange Crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame. This product taste like an orange juice, an artificial one but with less sugar and less flavor I didnt like it. I expected to like this drink because I like various fruit juices and I like carbonated beverages, as well.  Unfortunately, I just did not like the consistency or the taste of this drink. It was thick, had very little bubbly carbonation and, for me anyway, there was a very unpleasant aftertaste that lasted a loooong time.  I finally brushed my teeth really well and used some strong mouthwash to get rid of the taste in my mouth. I could not finish this drink, it is like drinking orange syrup. It may not have any added sugar in it but one can of 8.3 ounces has 34 sugar grams and 36 carbs. Ill stick to water when I want to quench my thirst! I was offered the opportunity to taste this product because of Vine. I would not normally purchase this type of product, so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard.Im not a big soda drinker, Id just rather drink water or coffee. I will occasionally drink a diet soft drink, usually Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke.Did you know that a single 12oz can of Coke Classic® has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar? This 8oz can of Switch has 140 calories and 34grams of sugar. And this is healthy? 4 ounces less is size, same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that Classic Coke. OK, so its not \"added\" sugar, but still, thats a lot of sugar. 100% Orange juice, 8 oz, has 120 calories and 28 grams of sugar.The can says it is \"Orange Tangerine\" but in fact the contents are #1: Water #2: Concentrates of Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola juices. Then they throw in some \"gum acacia\", \"natural flavors and colors\" and some \"ascorbic acid(vitamin C)\". And as a little surprise bonus, they have added \"soy\". Soy?I asked my wife to taste this product with me. I poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip. Her reaction was swift and strong... she hated it. I agreed with her. It was for me, sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth. Not only that, but the taste was just nasty. It didnt taste at all like orange or tangerine to me. It just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste. The carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience. Neither of us finished drinking our 4oz portion. It went down the sink.I would not purchase this product in the future and if I could have given it 0-stars, I would have. Its that bad. I have a big sweet tooth and thought I would really like this, but it was too sweet even for me. I even tried adding water, but that didnt help. I havent tried any of the other flavors, so I cant comment on the brand in general, but Ill never try this flavor again. These are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece.  If they were at my local grocery, I might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them.  I didnt really like the flavor that well, but if you did, they might even worth up to fifty cents per can.  Otherwise, pass these up. Ive tried other flavors of Switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them. However, this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet. I felt like I was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down. While I would probably purchase the other flavors of Switch, I definitely would not purchase this one. To me, fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple - first example that comes to mind is good ol Dole pineapple juice. The trend towards trendy little \"health\" beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic.There is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it. If I want a soda, Ill just grab one. I dont drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of \"100% What You Want\", there is nothing in here for me. If I want 100% Of What I Want, I will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water. If I want \"0% Of What You Dont Want\", well, why buy it?This is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity, and how to find a happy medium. I consider the likes of Pellegrino Aranciata, Orangina and Izze a luxury, and when I indulge it is a true delight.\"Switch\" is a product that is not better tasting, proven healthier, or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives. Once again marketing is driving product creation and design, and that is a hateful concept.If you want a similar taste experience for about the same price,  pick up some Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus Nighttime- youll stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great nights sleep. This is not orange and tangerine juice; its mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine. And I really dont care about the vitamin C content; vitamin C is easy to get.What I do care about is that this is definitely the worst-tasting soda of any type that I have ever tried. I couldnt pour it down the drain fast enough. The Switch Orange Tangerine looked very promising. 100% juice, with some zippy carbonation. I placed it in the fridge, and let it get a nice chill. Hours later, I popped the top, and my wife and I sampled...And it tasted like drinking furniture polish. Its not like we were searching for derogatory statements about Switch. Here is how the conversation went:Wife takes a swig, looks at me with eyes all googled. \"Yuck. It tastes like furniture polish.\"I take the can from her, thinking she must be insane. I chug some down. \"Ah, yeah...it does taste like furniture polish.\"We poured the remainder down the drain. If you enjoy drinking cold tangerine flavored furniture polish, by all means...BTW, this drink left a nasty aftertaste...still belching it up. I didnt like this drink at all! It had a very strange, almost chemically taste to it. I also didnt appreciate Switch marketing itself as \"all-natural\" but had ingredients like \"natural flavors and colors\". What are they?? Are they even natural?? I even let my three year old try it but she couldnt even swallow it and spit it out in the sink. Too bad. It would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste. My daughter and I much prefer the OOba Hibiscus drink. I wrote a 5 star review of the Kiwi Berry flavor.  That isnt usually my favorite flavor of anything, but it was surprisingly good.Orange Tangerine (which would generally be among my first picks of fruit-flavored beverages is flat by comparison -- literally.It seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation.  It also tastes weaker and too sweet.Try the Kiwi Berry instead. I tried this along with two of my children and we all agreed that it tastes like spoiled OJ but fizzier. Maybe it would be an acquired taste but I wont  be drinking it again to find out.Oddly enough the black cherry version is quite good. Ouch, this stuff is sweet, as in REALLY sweet...  This is really harsh tasting and we were disappointed.  Most soda doesnt have this much sugar, the 8.3 oz can has 29 grams of sugar, yikes!  For a 12 oz can of soda, that would be like having 45 grams of sugar, who would drink that?They need to water this WAY down, were going to end up giving the rest of this away, we cant drink it. I like the taste of this dressing, but realized that it contains the additive mono sodium gluconate. This chemical gives me migraines, which is very difficult to tolerate. I am sorry to say that I will no longer purchase this dressing unless they remove this flavor enhancer. THE LIDS DO NOT FIT. COFFEE RUNS OUT OF THE POD. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THERE ARE OTHER FILTERS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE MUCH BETTER. I will start by being kind, It is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this. It makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre-filled commercial K-cups you buy at the store.Now, I received my DisposaKups over a month after ordering them and put them to use.  I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable = landfill.They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.Sorry, I wish I had better news, I think I will return these. The product stinks and thats mildly stated.  The caps do not snap on easily and if you apply too much pressure the cup part caves in and you end up with ground coffee everywhere.  I threw the whole order into the trash and called it a day.  I will be using professionally produced K-cups (i.e, Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, even Folgers) from this point on. I was so excited to get these k cups and immediately filled 10, for future brewing, with my favorite coffee.  I tried one right away...  the coffee started running down the front of my Kreuig.  I thought I had filled the cup wrong and maybe not had the lid sealed well enough.... but when the coffee was done I opened the k-cup slot and found a melted wrinkled container.  I have subsequently tried more of the orrigional 10 that I filled, after carefully checking that they were properly put together, and all melted in the same way.  I have since thrown the rest away because I was tired of the mess they created!  Dont buy these... they do not stand up to hot water. For product to work properly (IMHO) you need coffee ground as fine as possible. Once filter has been inserted, plave carefully leveled measure of coffee in it. Manuever lid into place, then press down on center-STEADILY- w/ thumb.Plan to use no more than 6 Oz. of water for your cup.Removal of used cup from machine is occasional problem. (Jiggle it and it will generally loosen up.) The Solo K-cup works perfectly instead of these.  I Totally agree with the Poor Performance review.  I also got coffee grounds in my cup everytime I used these (yes even with the filter). The cup is poorly designed. It clogged the system causing the water to back up producing a half cup of coffee or water spilling outside the top of the unit. The products lid stays attached to the needle on the Keurig, allowing coffee grounds to fall everywhere. Very messy. If this didnt happen, it would work well. These cups were difficult to cap (putting the lids on securely was a comedy show) and they created a mess when used in the Keurig; the water went everywhere.  Add together PIA and MESS with an end outcome of weak cup o Joe = Im not a very happy buyer. The lids are impossible to secure.  This purchase was a complete waste of money.  Product cannot be used as lids are unable to be secured. I ordered the disposa kups with the thought of making my own kups. They dont fit together without a big production. The lids wont fit and water comes out the top of the brewer lid as well as the kcup. Just a big mess. not what I wanted at all. want to return them and get a refund. Donna Phillips I am sorry to say I had trouble with the cups themselves. Each time I used them, my machine would say \"decalcify\" which I did the first time. When I used them the 2nd and 3rd times, the problem occurred again. I was able to clear the hot water spout with a toothpick, which remedied the problem. I will not use them again, though, because I dont want to have to do that after every use. The units go together easily, but no matter how much or little coffee I put in the filter, it caused overflow. Its as if the filters are too thick. I also had a few cups that didnt pierce correctly.  Definitely not worth the money for these! These little cups are a waste of money. The Kerug machine had a difficult time processing the coffee through the cup, and as a result I ended up with several half cups of coffee.I tried it about 10 times, and then gave up. I got coffee grounds in my cup 4 out of the 5 times I used these. Very disappointed because I would like to use my coffee. The hole punctured in the bottom is larger than the one punched out with the regular K-cups, probably due to the design on the bottom of the cup. I have to flush the system each time I have used this product, wasting time and water. I tried these disposaKups several times, and each time the filter came loose at the top resulting in coffee and grounds everywhere.  The kup and lid are both made from flimsy plastic that softens at the brewing temperature.  The result is a loose fit at the top during brewing, distortion of kup at the bottom (because filter is forced down) and coffee and grounds everywhere.  The lids work one time with OEM Keurig kups (cleaned and refilled), but the second time they are loose and result in overflow.  An email to the company for a refund was not answered.  Do not buy these! I thought these would be the perfect answer. Sadly, I guess the pressure with which my Keurig machine shoots the water through the k-cup is too much for the disposa cup, because every single time I tried it, coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k-cup sits in my keurig. And yes, I used them properly.So the issue, at least in my Keurig machine, seems to be with the lids. Some have suggested its a design flaw with the Keurig machine. In either case, these disposa cups were NOT the answer for me.Biggest waste of money ever. I cannot recommend. I bought this through Amazon because most items i have purchased through them have been great.  THIS PRODUCT IS THE EXCEPTION.  They are very difficult to seal or close once filled, and they make one huge mess of your machine.  This product is just not ready for prime time. Also,  it isnt a cheap product.  The filters leak out of the sides which i dont understand as it cant be  sealed any better than i have been doing.  Most important, and this IS IMPORTANT, IT IS MADE IN CHINA, so you just cant be sure that it is free of chemicals that are released during the brewing process.  Other products clearly state that they are Chemical free.  I cant remember if it BTh or BHT, but take that into consideration.  BUY SOMETHING ELSE.  PLEASE. The service and delivery from Amazon was great.  However, the product itself is not worth buying.  No matter what I try, coffee leaks out around the Kcup when brewing....it makes a mess!  Wanted the cups to use my favorite coffee (Tim Hortons), but guess Ill just have to get used to other brands! My sister bought a Keurig. We all started using it. But mom still had her cans of coffee. I didnt want them to go to waste, so I bought this figuring I could make her k-cups with her own coffee. The cups are flimsy, first of all (most of them buckle too easily while getting the top on). It *looks* like a good seal (and yes, I made sure there were no coffee grounds on the edge, which I know can screw up the seal), but they still leak. Get one of the reusable cups. Itll be better for you and your Keurig. The lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water, the only I have not tried is putting 2 holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster. Its a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup! I would not buy anymore of them, unless I can fix the problem!!!!!No more disposebale K-cups for me! We put together the cups.  Everything went well with t he coffee into the cups along with a filter.When putting the kcup into the coffee machine it would only drip.  I checked everything and it was put together correctly. I took the made up cups to my sons coffee maker keurig brand also, it did the same thing.  It starts out ok only made drips of coffee.We tried it with two different modes of Keurig and both did not work.It did make holes in right places. I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didnt seem worth the effort to return them.  NOT a good product! I was really hoping that your product would solve my discontent with the Keurig coffe maker that I received for Xmas.  I am a coffee and chicory drinker so of course I wanted to have the same great coffee thru the Keurig machine.  The mesh filter that I bought first left a slimed residue in the brew....so I believed that the paper filter you created would do the job....well it does its work properly but it is a little large for the Keurig device....so water and grinds sort of go everywhere.......I dont think your product isnt good ...the whole Keurig experience is a great disappointment! These K-Cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made K-Cups. I now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the K-Cup and puncture it again for the water to come through. I think the material in the disposable K-Cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom. Well, at least they live up to their name. These nuts are definitely hot, too bad thats all the positive I have to say about them. Other than that, they taste like cardboard, and not very good cardboard either. MADE IN CHINA..Even our dog food has gone the way of the Hershey Kiss. I wont be back to this vendor.Will be looking for made and sold in AMERICA only..... These are a cheap fake. Nothing like the real Emerald nuts you buy in the store. Its a complete waste of money. DONT get ripped off like I did. Good quality product, but you would have to REAlly love curry flavor to like these... They are so awful I dont know what to do with them, but I know I wont be eating them.... Ill stick to the plain sea salt ones:) Unfortunately I am completely disappointed with this product. I have an above-average sense of smell, but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food. Perhaps I received part of a faulty batch? The seller is letting me return the bottle, but is requiring that I pay for shipping again, so I would be very unlikely to order from them again. Lacks the flavor I was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level.  I wont be ordering this again.  Live and learn. These are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates. If they contain brandy, it is too subtle for me to detect. A clue to the cause may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies. It appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked. But the box they came in shows no damage. A friend speculated that airline decompression burst them. Maybe, but other imported chocolates dont suffer this problem.I should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside.I cant really recommend these Laroshell candies. There are other brands which are quite good. I bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to Starbucks or Davinci Hazelnut syrup but its not. At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale. The price is only slightly better than what I can get the Davinci Brand at Sams club but the quality is far lower in my opinion. For hazelnut fans I suggest avoiding this particular brand. Im sorry I bought this brand. It leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth.No wonder Amazon is giving .99cent shipping on this item. STAY AWAY!!! AVOID!!!! Very disappointed, not much pumpkin or spice, just pretty close to plain old coffee.  I was hoping for something like they have at Tim Hortons but its not even close. I ordered the 6 month ice cream of the month club for my wifes birthday.  She received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams (you could have bought several of the ice creams, such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip, in your local grocery store).  When I called the 800 number I was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it doesnt \"meet their quality\" guidelines.  When I told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs, the customer service rep was rude and told me that I needed to call back and talk to someone in their \"support group\" (note: you must call before 6:00 PM EST to speak to someone in this group). I would seriously caution you to shell out more than $300 for this club. These are not black winter truffles (Tuber melanosporum).  I thought the price was too good to be true, (even though they arent fresh), and it is.  These are Tuber indicums.  It says so right on the label.I was very angry about this, but JR Mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them.  So I give JR credit for excellent  responsiveness and customer service, although I still feel they should not be labeled \"black winter truffles\". We tried these and they were bland and had no redeeming qualities. We sauteed them slightly and also tried them as is shaved. The price as some have mentioned reflects what you get for truffles.  Spend your money on white truffle oil youll be much happier, we are.  Also wait for the white truffles to come in from Italy, I would not knock JR as a company but would not recommend this offering. There was absolutly no scent or flavor to this.When I brought home truffles from Aosta in Italy they were wonderful and cost less. These were worthless. i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed. they are unlike truffles that i know of. they were hard like a huge seed, had no truffle aroma. i threw all contents out. will never order them again I should have listened to the negative reviews, but hoped that the positive reviews would ring more true. There was veery little truffle flavor that got entirely lost in the risotto I made. I agree with the other reviewers in that this was woody and flavorless. Not worth even this price for truffles. Little lesson on TRUFFLES...Truffles graded \"Extra\" are larger than most, the second highest in truffle quality. Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked \"brushed\" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle \"look\", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesnt allow for the real thing.NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If youre looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.Better to buy real truffle oil & experiment, for example \"JR Mushrooms & Specialties\" on Amazon, is a good start--about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). I was very excited about this purchase until I tried this truffle.These were horrible.  Maybe I got the worst bottle they have ever sold and I just happened to get them.  But, these are bad.  If you want to eat the root of a dirty old root of a tree, you will enjoy these.  If you doubt my credibility of my review, please feel free to read my other reviews.  Please dont waste your money.  My wife tried these and couldnt even believe these could be called truffles. Zero stars for this item.  I couldnt even confirm that the wrinkled little animal-offal sort of thing is a truffle.  This lacks any aromatic attraction at all.  Id be afraid to put it in anything I planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item.As for the famous JR service, my complaints about this product have been ignored. I am the biggest fan of mushrooms youll ever meet, but these are really disgusting. They taste like dirt. I have to imagine better quality truffles (if these are even truffles at all) are muuuuch better. Theyd have to be. Thered be no comparison. These are really bad. This is the worst flavored coffee I have ever tried.  There is no aroma or flavor of Chocolate/Raspberry to this coffee bean at all.  In fact the coffee tastes sour.  I too am sorry I couldnt buy just 1 lb. to try it first -- Now I am stuck with this awful coffee I cannot return.  SO, BUYER BEWARE -- NO RETURNS! I like some of Coffee Bean Direct coffees, but I cannot stand the taste of this one, and no one else in the house likes it either. I wish I could of bought it in a smaller package, rather than the 5 lb bag that cost over $30. I do not recommend this product to anyone, but everybody has their own taste, and some people may like it. This is an awful coffee. The flavor is extremely weak and tastes more like a lemon grass tea than coffee. Check out the nutritional info, the SODIUM: 5,510 grams! 230% of your daily requirement. I used this and our casserole was ruined because it was so salty!!!!!! And whats up with that price? My box cost a dollar. Unfortunately I bought two boxes, so Im throwing the other box away. No bargain here. It is wildly UN-delicious and UN-healthy for you!(Yeah, Im embarrassed that I didnt read the label first!) I have placed two orders for the weber grill grinder roasted garlic herb in the past.  I was so disappointing the last time I picked up my order as it was not what I had ordered.  It was citrus twist with garlic.  I just love the garlic and herb grinder and have given my first order away to my family as Christmas gifts.  I now dont even have one bottle for myself.  You can see I have reordered the garlic herb and hope I will receive what I have ordered.  It would be so inconvenient to repackage and return.  If it was possible to buy it in my location I would but its not available.Very DisappointedLeonaThe order that I received with the citus garlic was as follows.Transaction Date  11/03/2011LocationAmount  $20.94Reference Number  [...]Description  Amazon.com AMZN.COM/BILLWA You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $25 AND you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items, some of which you may not like.Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. The Nespresso capsule offers posted on Amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who dont know better. tastes - burnt, roasted, slightly rotten sunflower seed taste; gritty, bland - no salt,sugar only seeds. would not eat if it was free.\" I almost never write reviews, but I thought I would for this one.  Im pretty open to tastes of anything, but something about the smell and taste of this product was really bad.  It tasted \"off\" almost.  Im really disappointed because I had hoped to like it and I love fruity green teas, but this was NO GOOD.  Id strongly recommend trying a sample of this (if possible) before buying.  Sorry Zhenas.... maybe Ill like another flavor.  I havent given up on you yet. This soup is advertised as \"creamy,\" however when it arrived it was \"signature.\"  Puck changed the recipe of the Creamy Butternut Squash Soup and is now calling it Signature Butternut Squash Soup.  It does not taste the same (and is not as good) as the original recipe. The soup is rich and tasty, but DONT buy it from Amazon.  The packaging is so poor that the cans arive dented as did the replacement shipment. I got my money back but now have to pay more to buy this wonderful soup from my local grocer. This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese.  It is just so so in taste.  If you check the ingredients it is not much different than other Mac and Cheese.  The cost does not justify the ordering.  I will not be ordering from Amazon again.  The cost is much cheaper at a big box chain. I bought a new bread machine and bought this collection of bread mixes as well as some single mixes to try it out.  The single mixes worked well as they included yeast packaged separately in the mix.  My machine states clearly not to get the yeast wet, to put it on top of the flour away from the water.  The mixes in this collection have the yeast in the flour, not packaged separately.  The bread failed to rise at all.  Why would they package the yeast separately in the single mixes and not in the multi packs?  Along with the Heartland Collection I also purchased the Bakers Choice Collection.  I am throwing them all out.  Dont waste your money. The bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes 1/2 loaf.  I checked the temp of the water as suggested with bad results.  After raising the temp to 100 degrees I got it to rise to 3/4 loaf.  Pretty expensive for the quality and I wont buy again. I bought this because the ingredients seem to be ok but for some reason it made my dogs have to go outside at least 3 times each night, overnight for the 2 weeks we gave this to them.  We changed back to Origen, a food they do well on and the middle of the night bathroom trips stopped in 2 days. Also, my older dog tends to get really \"diggy\" when she is eating something not good for her and with this food she was constantly digging at the couch!  I have no idea what is wrong with this food, none of the ingredients stand out to me as being the cause but something in it really messed my puggies up! I just received the plant.  I paid extra for a quick delivery to secure the plants condition.  It arrived on time, however it arrived wrapped only in moist news paper,without any protection for the plant.  The plant is completely smashed. This was, for me, a complete waste of my time and money.  I paid more for shipping than for the item itself and it didnt do a bit of good.  Very disappointing. this plant appears to be dead on arrival.... ive had in full sun since arrival and its leaves and stems are pink and not growing at all ide order another one but it will probably die in the slow shipping as well 20.00 for a dead weed... no thanks they wouldnt let me submit this review with out clicking a star... not even worth one star note the picture they used for this product has six more branches than mine...i have three Ordered this plant to remedy a fruit fly invasion. The amazon shipping was acceptable, but the manufacturer does not create the packaging to facilitate any shipment, unless they were to put \"This side up\" on the box. The dirt was everywhere but where it was supposed to be and the plant (Audrey) was upside down, roots up in the box. If I had found one locally I would have bought it there. Hoping Audrey survives, but I dont have high hopes.EDIT: Audrey is now deceased. Do not recommend. Plant was dead on arrival and was mangled in its container, probably better to buy one locally. I dont think its gonna make it.... The plant was upside down in the box and I had to put the roots back inside the planter.  It never came out of shock and turned black and died. Hi  - ordered the Venus fly trap...very quick service, nice vendor, but the plant died and turned black...over the next 3 days after we got it... i had a second plant to replace the first one. it to came in sad shape,i should of went to a local nursery at least then i would of got a good plant.dont waste your time with this vender. The plant arrived dead.  It cost as much to ship.  I did not want to hassle with any kind of return.  I should know better than to buy a plant on line. I received an undersized, sickly plant that could not be nurtured back to health. What was I thinking ordering a plant over the Internet? Never again! It only lasted 2 days. Came mostly dead. Glad it was only 10 bucks. It was also very small so. The flies I wanted it to eat , it couldnt. I ordered this plant as a gift for a friend and was not told until recently that the plant had died shortly after she received it.  She said she followed care instruction but the leaves started to fall off and it wilted and died.  I wish I had known sooner but she just told me last week. Two of the three plants were dying and are now dead. They all were tiny!!! They are suppose to catch flies but not one fly has been caught because they couldnt even fit in the bloom.  Rip Off!!! Do not do business with this vendor... i recieved the fly trap and it seemed fine i put it in a nice sunny area it did good but then 2 days later it just died so i paid 15 bux for a plant that lived 3 days lol I was given a track number and told it was delivered to my POBOX.  It never happened.  I received a refund and am now in the process of wating for my new reorder. I must be the odd man out here...but this powdered goat milk is horrible!  My 18 month old son is allergic to dairy and soy, hence the reason for goat milk.  We were going on vacation for two weeks, and I was afraid there would not be any source of goat milk at that destination. Being he drinks almost a quart a day of regular liquid goat milk I purchase from Trader Joes, I figured I would go for the gusto and buy a two weeks supply for him. It smelled horrible and more importantly tasted horrible! Words cannot even describe how disgusting this stuff was.  My poor son almost threw up from tasting it which prompted me to smell it.  It smelled so bad, I couldnt even taste it myself.  Maybe were just used to the regular brand he drinks?  My only advice, try a small amount first.  It is not returnable!!! I dont know how people could say this doesnt smell or taste bad. It is horrible!! I was getting raw goats milk for quite a while and when we moved it wasnt available. The fresh raw milk was delicious and mild and did not have that gamey odor and flavor that this milk has. Maybe some people dont mind the taste, maybe some acquire a taste for it, and maybe some even like it, but I think it is vile. If you like the taste of the goats milk cheese in stores, then you may like this, if not, stay far, far away! THE CAN DOES NOT SAY \"NO ANTIBIOTICS\". I called the company and asked why the can does not say this.  First, she tells me that THEY HAVE NO ANTIBIOTICS BUT the FDA wont allow them to put it on their can.  I said \"lots of companies put no antibiotics on their label\".  Then she said we are making a new label.  I felt a definate flippant attitude.  I felt like she just wanted me to get off the phone.Well, I just canceled my autoship for their goat milk. I am now looking for another goat milk that puts \"no antibiotics\" on their label.  I know that there are some good goat milk companies that do this. $136 for 12 boxes?Is this a rare item?Thats $11.33 a box.I think the item might be a bit overpriced. I do not like sour taste and this has a sour kind of taste which i dont like. The smell isnt that great either i got this in the mail nice packaging and all opened it up to see its single serving bags 3oz of hot water to a bag ...not gallon size =( so i decided to make some and it tasted like the little pink bubble gum \"double bubble\" i used to get as a kid yuck so not what i was expecting... Tasteless, basically says it all.  I love tea.  Drink it every day.  I found this undrinkable.  Great packaging, but not a good tea for me. I bought this tea cause I had consumed the one from the bottle and I like that one.However in tea bag is not just tasting totally and completely different, but additionally tastes reallyhorrible... believe me, I even tried to give it to my co workers for free after they tried it and they did not accept it.In my opinion It tasted like Serum :s. Now I have 100 tea bags wasting space, probably soon theyll go to the waste bascket.Its sad... I thought it would taste like the bottle or at least close, but totally a disappointment. Wolfgang Puck recently changed their Chicken soup. The old stuff is excellent. The new stuff is watered down, not filling and doesnt taste as good. The image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup. The soup I received is the new stuff. Being a food item, returns are not allowed. I feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased. I was familiar with a few of Wolfgangs recipes before I tried any of his soups. First I tried a different flavor a year ago, but cant remember anything except it being bland and slimy.  I decided to try it a 30 minutes ago because I was desperate for something healthy and convenient because I was a tad sick and could not make my own unprocessed meal with the ingredients I had home. I bought it for about $3 and hoped I just had a bad can of soup the first time, but this was just awful. No taste, slimy, and hardly any chicken (probably 3-4 tiny pieces). I can see why they added such little chicken. Its just tasteless and dry; tasted nothing like chicken. Ill go try another can of soup that can make me feel a bit better. This sure didnt do it. I have never had soup that tasted bland even after adding salt and seasoning. I see positive reviews that make me thing I had another bad can because I still cant believe it had absolutely no flavor. This soup has no flavor. Broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid-y one. I was so disappointed. I can get this at my local grocery store for $2.69 per can ($32.28 for 12). In court, as I understand it, youre not supposed to testify about anything where you dont have direct experience.  You can discount this review if you want, since I have only second hand experience with this soup.I gave a case of this soup to a young friend who is a college student (I worry about her starving).  She never mentioned whether she liked the soup, so I asked.  She finally admitted that it was, to quote her, \"The worst thing Ive ever tasted\".  Apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well.  While my friend is rather picky, her boyfriend has a much wider culinary range, so if they both disliked the soup, Im inclinded to think its not very good. I found this exact same product, same size at our local grocery store (QFC and Safeway) for $2.99. So, am not sure why this product is priced so much higher. $5.00 over the local grocers regular price. I expected a fair market price when I placed this order, but because I didnt research it I was extremely disappointed to find it so inflated. Live and learn, I hope I can save someone else the trouble of having to make a return. I purchased this food coloring hoping it would create black frosting. I read several reviews on this and other websites which suggested I use chocolate icing (as white icing + black food coloring= gray frosting) but this product did not darken the chocolate at ALL. I ended up using over half for one cake and still decided the color wasnt right. It was still obviously brown. Perhaps my expectations were too high. Whats in this stuff?  Wheres the list of ingredients?I dont eat anything unless I know and approve of whats in it.For example, although this products description says it contains no sugar, it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners, which are also bad for you.For one thing, aside from tasting awful, artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea.In addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises (e.g: \"natural\" cane juice, fruit juices, \"raw\" sugar, \"organic\" sugar, etc.), I also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind.So, whats in this stuff? I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyones taste is different), Im going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new \"worst\" one.FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me. The protein powder is ok, not to good as i expected. if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white, which is very bad in taste, not at all drinkable. I used this product cod roe (tarako spaghetti sauce )to eat when i feel lazy at japan.that very cheap and just boil pasta and mix this pouch becausei ate that product once a week in japan. after i moved here america year ago i really miss some asian food because little expensive butwhen i see picture i remind how good and excited because i bought this from amazon .BUT taste little different , I was disappointed, too strong smell like a ocean .I throw garbage because i did not remember product of japan america. i never ever buy this in america. This sounded so tasty from the reviews and the flavors were enticing...so I ordered some.  We had some for breakfast today and then went to pack the other boxes in bags to go to the homeless shelter.  To us, it is dreadful.  It has the texture of paste and not even palatable...for us.  Am throwing out the box we opened and canceling my order on subscribe and save.  When you consider how easy it is to make real oatmeal, Im sorry I was fooled by these flavors. Caribbean Joy coconut milk offers a tempting price, lower than its competitors.  Theres a good reason for its low price: by all accounts it tastes like half the visible amount is coconut milk, the rest being water.Neither good for pina coladas or cooking, this is a poor value and I cant recommend it to anyone. Gold Prince has made a terrible mistake.  There are two products.  COLDAID and FLUAID.  THey are different formulary.  Unfortunately they display Fluaid picture on the Amazon website and their own website but the words are COLDAID.  THere is a separate product for Coldaid.  Regardless -- if you order the FLUAID on AMAZON you will get the COLDAID...the picture is not the product...the words under the drop down menu are worthless...as they all default to the same product COLDAID.  If you want FLUAID, which is the superior product, dont buy it from AMAZON or off of the sellers website.  It is a mistake.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P936UK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldnt be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star. Sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed income. She said it was horrible and would be throwing the other 2 boxes out. So I would not reccomend this product. I had pretty high hopes for the Busy Bone. I have a large, active chewer (the kind of dog that has to have several bones to choose from all the time if you dont want her to chew up your bed frame). I was hoping that with the Busy Bones long-lasting promise, I might be able to just give her one of these and at least have time to wash the dishes. Why dont I describe what happened next...I was in the kitchen washing the dishes. It had been about fifteen minutes since Id given the dog the bone. Deeply absorbed in annoyance with myself for not rinsing said dishes, I was scrubbing vigorously when an awful sound met my ears: a terrible and hauntingly familiar crunching noise. The dog was eating my bed. So I go into the bedroom to scold her and even before I get a chance to look at the bed frame, I am struck by the mess she has caused. The Busy Bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles ALL over the floor. Too small and numerous to pick up by hand and too gushy for the vacuum cleaner to clean up, the oobleck has to be washed out of the carpet with a dish rag. And did I mention that theyre expensive?I will continue to stick with real bones that I purchase from the butcher. Theyre cheaper, they last longer, and they dont leave a terrible mess. I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ½ year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.Im left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as Ive since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  Im 57 years-old and Ive put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  Shes simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I. Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the worlds finest breeds in competition for \"Best in Show,\" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss weve suffered at your negligent hands? I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we dont breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone. I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it werent for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  Youd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically thats not the case. Yet theres more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, hes now subdued.  Hes actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesnt understand why.  This concerns me. I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Gretas death could have been prevented. Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasnt it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didnt Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores? The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Loris and my life.  Well never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  Its now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ½ years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  Its a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina. The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product. Karl and Lori Former owners of beloved Greta, purebred female pug.  Our baby.  Gone forever. I had used this frequently on and off over the years and didnt realize that it is not sold in the US any longer.  In the past the instructions were in English on the packet but I dont recall what they were. Now it is entirely in German and no one I know speaks a word of the language. I dont have a scanner so one of the solutions suggested wont work.  Dont buy before realizing that if you dont speak German and have no one to translate you are in a pickle.. I have 10 packs now!  Another thing, all 10 packs expire in 6 months time, so dont buy in bulk unless you plan to eat a lot of sauerbraten.  Rated 1 only because I am unable to use the product and the product description does not mention either the language issue or the near term expiration date. All baking soda is aluminum free. This is an unnecessary marketing ploy to get you to buy their product. Buy this because it is naturally mined and is cruelty free; but do not be duped into thinking that good ole $.59 Arm&Hammer has aluminum in it. BTW the chemical process used to make A&H is almost exactly what occurs in nature; just faster but not cheaper. It costs no more to mine sodium bicarbonate than it does to manufacture. So yes you are paying for a name. I just called Bobs Red Mill customer service (just do a G search for the company, their customer service number is under \"contact us\" on their site), and I was annoyed to learn that NONE OF BOBS RED MILL BAKING SODA CONTAINS ALUMINUM. Ive been paying $10-15 (with shipping) for this magical aluminum free baking soda only to learn that the Bobs Red Mill premium baking soda at my local grocery is the same exact thing. Call for yourself if you dont believe me. Ugh. I was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace. The bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route.  When I opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place.  I could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so I threw it away.  I made a mess all over the place  What a waste.  I will not be ordering from this company again. What constitutes a good coffee is rather subjective. You can read countless reviews about it, but you dont know until youve tried it for yourself.  Having enjoyed peaberry coffee (I think the spherical shape results in better roasting) from many different parts of the world , I gave this a shot based on the positive reviews posted and the great price.  Boy, was I disappointed!  The beans are light/medium in roast, has a mild subdued smell.  The beans looked dry, but this is not uncommon for light roasts.  I made a fine grind of the beans, and brewed it in a press. Sad to say, it was the most disappointing cup of coffee I have had in a long time.  The flavor was stale, without any fruity characteristic of peaberries, and reminded me of a cheap cup of joe from a dirty diner.  The worst part is I am stuck with 3 lbs of terrible coffee that cannot be returned (Amazon does not accept return of food items). I rarely post a product review, but I feel that I would be irresponsible as a consumer if I did not comment on the Tanzania Peaberry whole coffee beans. I had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and I did my best to tolerate them. To illustrate, I have consumed almost one whole bag of the three, but will have to dump the other two in the trash! The beans are stale, dry, over-roasted, with little flavor. Even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help! I resolved that this morning would be my last cup! I will have to resort to buying the Eight OClock brand at my local grocery store. I even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend, but decided that it wasnt worth alienating him! Coffee Bean Direct, you need to do better, MUCH better... Once again I find myself trying to like Tazo herbal teas, but they keep putting licorice in teas where is just doesnt seem to belong, to me anyway.  This is another example where I expected a lovely flavored tea and the licorice flavor is so strong, its just about all I can taste.  I guess Ill just give up on Tazo - who ever blends all their teas has radically different taste buds than mine! This tea was not what I expected.  I love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product.  The tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which I enjoy.  This tea has a stronger Rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor.  Furthermore, I found that the product description does not give a full list of the teas ingredients.The ingredients listed on the box include:  Cinnamon, Licorice Root, Orange Peel, Indian Sarsaparilla, Chicory Root, Rooibos, Natural Flavors, Star Anise, Almond Extract and Locorice Extract Well I bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely. Pink Salmon is very good for you.This time I ordered again, received ALBACORE TUNA INSTEAD OF PINK SALMON. AMAZON DOES NOT DO RETURNS ON GROCERIES SUCH AS THESE, EVEN IF NOT OPENED THAT I CAN SEE. I sent personally an email to Raincoast Trading Company based in Canada, also left a phone message as well. Delayed response, but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item. Gone through hoops in the help center of Amazon to no avail. Until I found the Toll Free Amazon phone number, Amazon LLC confirmed they can not accept the return, but will send the correct item promptly. We shall see, awaiting a replacement item.A minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon I am used to ordering.Anyone want some tuna? O well.P.S. Updated  review Sept 30th 2009, I finally got the ordered item, partly because the Amazon rep corrected it when I called in and sent it fast! BTW, it cost me a Toll Call to Canada to the company without a prompt reply. That just added insult to injury. Well I was able to order from a different merchant through Amazon. Thank you Amazon for coming through :) I purchased this product to lure black bear to the bait pile. The product has no sweet smell as one would expect. I have asked for a refund or exchange from the supplier, no response. I got sent the wrong item, which happens i know.  I tried to contact the company multiple times with no response.  I finally had to contact amazon and they are returning the item for me... My cat has an iron stomach. She can eat absolutely anything and everything and is always getting into my \"human\" food and has never thrown up. I gave her 2 of these treats and within 20 minutes, she was wheezing and throwing up all over my carpet. I didnt connect it at first but when I gave her the same treats the next day, exact same reaction!I have tried several different flavors of this same brand and she has had the same reaction! If you are trying these with your cat for the 1st time, only give them 1 of them and just wait to see how they react before you give them anymore. Both of my cats (age 11) threw up for an extended period after eating just 3 of these. Into the trash they go (not the cats, the treats). Not sure what they were reacting to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk. My sweet little Persian looks like she is dying. Shes been puking all night because of these treats. How has this item not been recalled? I have two cats. My big boy has eaten these and never had a problem...as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since I adopted him at 2 months. My girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor. Since I treat them equally these are no longer purchased. I hate to see my girl sick so I just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats. If not a problem...carry on. Ive tried it with both my cats, several times. Every time they eat this, and other Whiskas Temptations products, they vomit within minutes.They LOVE it, they WANT it, its CHEAP but it makes them puke, so, Id consider this a bad purchase. Both of my cats vomit from all Temptations treats, but especially the Hairball variety. One of my cats actually is getting hairballs from these treats when he didnt before. Ive tried all of them, and minutes after they eat their treats they vomit. This doesnt happen with any other treats like Whisker Lickins or Pounce. I dont want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, its more of a warning from my own personal experience so others dont make a mistake.When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. Im sure theres a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasnt vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really arent kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package. I finally did the research on this temptation treats and Im glad to see that my suspicions are correct. I have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting. Ironically, I even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting. Now is official, I stopped giving them to him as often, and then monitored him whenever I gave him any. It soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever I give him this treats. Sometimes he would vomit within minutes, and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning, but if I give him this treats, Im sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after.  I think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients, and they probably dont do anything to other cats but Im never buying this again for my kitty. You know, I was searching the Internet for the words \"temptations\" and \"vomit\" when I came across these reviews.  I was surprised to hear that Im not the only one who has had problems with this product.  Within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about 40 minutes.  I didnt realize it was the cause until the second time I fed them to her.  Its really bad because it doesnt cause the cat to throw up all at once.  Its like she can just vomit a little at a time and youre forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit ((or locking her in the bathroom (which is horrible)). Like many others on here, my cat was vomiting within minutes of eating these \"tasty\" treats. She really loves them, however they dont love her back. It took me about a week to put this product and my sick kitty together. Finally after a google search, I came across these reviews. I stopped giving her the treats and so far, my cat has been vomit free. Buyer beware, this might not happen with every cat, so it may be wise to start slow with this product to see how your pet will react and build up slowly. Back to her \"greenies\" I go!! I have fed my 2 cats these treats the last 2 days.  Within 5 minutes of eating them, they are both throwing up.  I will be going back to the Three Dog Bakery Treats.  Expensive but have never made my cats sick.  Why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews? My one year old cat ate a few of these and seemed lethargic.  Two weeks later I gave him a large helping of theseand I thought he was going to die.  He laid around and would not eat or move for two days.  I will not feed him theseagain.  Same thing happened to my parents cat after eating the salmon variety. My sister gave her cats these and loved them, so I got them for my cats. Our 4 cats have been vomiting a lot lately, and we traced it back to these treats. Google whiskas temptations recall...they were recalled not too long ago and I dont know why they are still on shelves. Dont buy these... They will make your cat sick and who know what else its doing to their internal system. Please keep your cats away from this product! ive never written an amazon review before, but this product was so horrible i had to warn would be buyers; i can eat pretty much anything, but i had to empty out both bottles... it just tasted like colored sugar water (very thin), sickening sweet.. dont know if there was any onion flavoring.. the only reason i bought this is because i couldnt get kens steakhouse vidalia onion dressing shipped in California.  So far, the worst product i have purchased on amazon.  Buyer beware, unless you like sugar water, then \"drink up\"..blech. I love these crackers but not the price change.At $29.00 for 12 boxes; ~$2.42 a box if you sign up for \"Subscribe and Save\" I was ecstatic. I most definitely signed up for \"Subscribe and Save\" delivery.Not yet 2 months later I learn the identical item now cost $55.00 for 12 boxes.Bait and switch?I think these crackers taste better than their clone parent the Triscuit. 12 boxes is just right for a two month period- I keep a couple boxes at work. Use them for bringing nibblies to gatherings and more importantly as a stable of my diet because I choose not to eat bread and I love food items with ingredient lists like this: Whole Wheat, Expeller-Pressed Oleic Safflower Oil, Sea Salt, Natural Tocopherols Added to Preserve Freshness.As a big city dweller who uses public trans (I dont own a car)I rely on Amazon for certain essential groceries. I pick them up at the UPS store on my walk home from the train stop. Its one of the main reasons Im a \"Prime\" member.Ill need to cancel my \"Subscribe and Save\" for this item. I like to think Amazon wasnt going to send the next delivery without notifying me of the new price.I can get Triscuits anywhere for ~$4.50 a box, sometimes less. The Back To Nature cracker is now $4.59 a box.Its likely the pricing situation is out of their hands but Im so disappointed!Looks like Ill be checking out the cracker selection at CostCo. Does anyone realize tocopherol usually comes from soy? Im still hunting for a cracker I dont have to make. Their website is unclear about its source. Used for less then 2 months both cats fur began falling out bad.Stopped using it & the cats fur is back to fine.Back to feeding my cats Natures Variety instinct.I baught this PetGaurd product at Fairway Market not Amazon.Will not use it again. I used to order this product at 25 per box of 12 cans and now it turned into 50 dollars??? how did it double out of nowhere?? This is a good decaf coffee, but Ive never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. Its extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess. Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. Im still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didnt notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself! No where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee.  By the name I thought it was a Jamaican Blue Mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut.  Not very good I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazons description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated. I thought this was a Jamaican blend or roast, but turns out its simply a heavily flavored coffee.  The flavor tastes artificial - like fake maple syrup flavoring.  We have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips.  Now I have to find a home for the rest of it so it doesnt go to waste. I wish Amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such.  Then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee.  This stuff tastes the way I imagine Newmans Own Extra Bold coffee would taste with curdled, spoiled Baileys Irish Cream dumped in it - nasty.  Shudder!!! Coffee tastes great, but the cups get torn apart when brewing.  What a mess that is!!  I am quite disappointed because I do like this flavor of coffee!! It sure would be nice if they stated ANYWHERE in the description of this coffee that it is flavored.  I love the Bed and Breakfast coffee, its just plain coffee, so I was surprised when I received the Jamaica coffee and it was flavored.  YUCK! I ordered 3 boxes of 18 each.............and opened one box to find they were PODS and notfor Keurig, AND I cant return them!!!?????  Yes,the pods fit into the Keurig butthe end product is weak and awful.  I am most disappointed Didnt realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-. Gave it away the next day at work. This flavor is horrible.  There are many other flavors much better.  Hawaiian Hazelnut is great!  Breakfast in Bed is AWesome! Probably because it doesnt taste like coffee.  It is flavorless.  I saw the good reviews and thought Id get a couple boxes and now Im stuck with a bunch of k cups that I dont want to drink because Id rather literally drink any other k cup Ive ever tried.  As you can see Im not a fan of these k cups.  These are the worst ever. ...I will drink this if all other coffee options are exhausted. The coffee has a vanilla/coconut smell but after a sip or two, I cant drink it. Would not purchase again and Im having trouble even giving it away. I expected more from Wolfgang Puck. I love caramel and was excited when this arrived. But I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. Hardly any flavor at all, of coffee or caramel I love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode!!  The glue on the side of the cup becomes undone and then the cup explodes.  Very hard to clean up.  Do not think I will buy this brand again! This coffee says Dark Roast & Extra Bold and.... IT ISNT! Its weak and barely beats out a cup of Folgers. I bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite (Jet Fuel or Emerils Big Intense Bold) liked this one. Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label.It is **NOT** bold.  It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and thats very unusual.Im going to contact the company to see if theyll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad. As coffee in general, this Wolfgang variety was alright. However, I was expecting a \"Creme Caramel\" taste, or something similar, and I dont feel this delivered. I tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just didnt do it for me. It is marketed as a flavored coffee, yet I could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee. This is a good French roast coffee, although it could be a little bolder. Ive never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. Its extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess. I am only drinking it, so it wont be wasted, and I have to rotate it with a Coffee People product, so I remember why I like coffee.  It is really wan. The strongest flavor profile is tin.  I love creme caramel and am a huge WP fan, but the flavor strenth and consistancy of this coffee does not impress. Choose another - you wont be sorry you did. This is the 1st K-cup coffee that I am getting grounds in my coffee. It is occuring about every 3 cups. I have not had this problem with other K cup manufactures. I will not reorder. I bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of. It tastes like hotdog water. I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable. This was the nastiest flavored coffee I have ever had in kcups. I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his brand. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I brewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness. I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee. I use to purchase Jamaica beans locally and it was great. This Jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it. The odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale. Other people in household tried it and couldnt get past the first cup. Pitched the remainder cups in the trash. This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty \"sludge\" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didnt even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldnt really afford at this time. I sent a letter of complaint to the Wolfgang Puck company and, except for a \"cookie cutter\" letter acknowledging receipt of my comment, I have not received any further contact from them. Unfortunately, Im much too frugal to throw away something Ive spent perfectly good money on, so Im continuing to use these suckers until theyre gone (hopefully in a few weeks). I thought I was buying a decent brand of coffee, given the Wolfgang Puck name, but alas, I was wrong. Using the middle cup size on my Keurig coffeemaker, these k-cups make a weak cup of coffee... more like brown water. No taste, no nothing. I switched to the smallest size cup and its marginally better, but still barely drinkable. I wouldnt serve these to guests EVER. I cant wait to be done with these boxes of junk so I can order something with some taste. Please dont waste your money. this was terrible coffee Wolfgang Pucks Jamaicamecrazy, I received a partial refund but felt I should have gotten a full refund as I cant drink the coffee and had to throw it all away. Also had to pay shipping and should not of had to. I would like a response to this. I found this coffee to be great at first, but as I started having it more and more I came to detest it. On the large setting the coffee is WAY too watery. Also, the flavor is very, very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas.It is a pretty good mid-afternoon or evening desert coffee, but other than that it is kinda gross. I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.  It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more \"class.\"  This tastes artificial and it cant stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener.  Will not buy again! Really?  Who blends this stuff and decides that it is good?  Ugh.  I can sum this nastyness up in one quick phrase.  Stale airline coffee!  If you like that flavor, then you will love this one, if you dont like thin cardboard soaked, never washed the pot out, and the water came from a tin canteen, flavored coffee, then you wont like this one either!  I would give this zero stars if I could.  WOW, likely the worst cup of coffee that I have ever had.  I hope Wolfy reads this as his name is on the package and I expected more, now I know not to buy any of his signature products, awesome, thanks for saving me $$ next time!  The package says Extra Bold, but it doesnt taste extra bold.  Its almost like they put some ground instant powder in the mix to make it stronger. The coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt.  I cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt.  Will not order this again. Im amazed that people are happy with this product.  Im not a drinker of the dark brews, French roast or anything, but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee, this is completely tasteless.  The initial scent is delicious, too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee. To me this coffee was extremely bitter.  I dumped it out and made a different cup.  It made me afraid to try other WP coffees but I did like the WP Sumatra Kopi Raya.For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.My favorite k-cups are:Starbucks French RoastStarbucks Caffe VeronaStarbucks Pike Place RoastGreen Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran ReserveGreen Mountain Double Black DiamondGreen Mountain RevvGreen Mountain Dark MagicOther k-cups Ive tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold This Wolfgang Puck Coffee Jamaica Me Crazy is the worst coffee Ive ever had!I threw it out right away after one sip! It taste like all coconut flavoring.Hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. They should be fired! Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee... If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldnt believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emerils. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share Ill stick with offering The Coffee Peoples Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as Id be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices Ill not be duped again. Ill stay away from any of the other WP offerings. This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didnt like it either and I ended up throwing it out. Ok...TODAY 4/15 this company decided to put them up for sale at 12.50 per 24pk...  This advertisement was on SLICKDEALS.NETWell... Went to order and refreshed the page and in my cart was now 1 at 36 dollars???? so they sold one out of my cart.Next.... I waited 20 mins to see if it was a fluke and SD.NET started claiming dead link.Well upon refreshing again... they were now 44.95 for one 24 pack...Hey RIDICULOUS SELLER..... GET WITH THE PROGRAM ...IF THIS IS YOUR WAY OF RECOVERING QUICK MONEY...I THINK PEOPLE ARE MUCH SMARTER THEN THAT UPON PRESSING CONFIRM MY ORDER>..... ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO YOU FOR BEING SO UN-TECH-SAVY The worst!!! it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the Hazel Nut flavor at all!!!!!  Do not buy this product save your money!!!!! I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it cant be returned. I bought both the Creme Caramel and this Hazelnut kcup and I couldnt tell them apart even if my life depended on it... The flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too and unlike the Caramel one, this one has a nasty bitter aftertaste like the flavor is artificial.  Yeah, I know its artificial but I hate that it actually tastes like a chemical!  Yuk...This is one of those coffees you can serve to company who doesnt know good coffee or people you dont want to have come to your house any more as one cup of this and they wont be your friends after it!  It really is quite bad. this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe... its artificially flavored, and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it. My household hated it. Of course, that would be my problem if the description was accurate, but its not. Amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page. Are these people crazy or can I not multiple properly? This is $43 for 24 small cups of peaches.  That works out to $7 for the 4 pack.  This 4 pack cost about $3.50 in a grocery store in the states but because Im deployed Im suppose to pay $7 for it?! Not happening. Netgrocer.com is $4.00; higher than a grocercy store, but cheaper than this! Product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in December of 2009. Product leaked from seal in carton. and the expiration date on top of the can says Jan.06,05. I cannot even return it since it is a grocery. Amazon, are you serious? When I bought this food, I saw the image and price and assumed that I would be paying a fair price ($1 less per bag than the grocery store) for low grade cat food. The image and price combination led me to think that I would be paying $45 for 6 18lb+ bags - a good deal. When I received six 3.6lb bags, I thought there had been a mistake. Nope. So, I spend $40+ returning it (I bought three 6 packs - oops) and now Ozbo customer service tells me they take 2-3 weeks processing returns! My kitties need food now, and these people want to sit on my $180 for that long? DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS !!! Im on a low sodium diet and use this product regularly.  Think it is very good.  Try their salsa.  Couple of jars of this & a couple of jars of another pasta suace, spices, seasonings, etc.  However, the $44.00+ shipping cost is a major rip-off.  Try one of two or three sites on Google.  You will save $20.00 to $30.00 a case. This is a good product, especially for iced coffee, but why is it twice the price as it is in stores?  This isnt a fluke--within the past two months Ive bought it for $5 a jar in Seattle and in Nevada, so it just looks like good old-fashioned gouging.  Try harder Amazon. Medaglia DOro has to be the worst coffee Ive ever had. It had an old musty flavor and odor. You get what pay for. I of course prefer freshly made espresso but sometimes instant is good in a pinch.  I travel around Europe extensively and there are several brands available there which arent at all bad.  This brand is OK for using it as a coffee flavoring in custards, etc., but as a beverage, it rates rock bottom in my book. I was hopeful, but left unsatisfied. The color of the bean grounds says it all; a light brown not the typical dark brown to black of real espresso, even decaf. Taste is weak and odd, not rich and solid. Certainly not worth the extra $$. Recommend Cafe Bustelo instead. Before I ordered this coffee, I read reviews both here at Amazon and on other sites.  I used reviewers comments to base my decision to purchase it.  I am a lover of Starbucks Espresso Decaf coffee.  I have my own Breville espresso machine at home.  I have been using Starbucks for years.  My Lavazzo coffee arrived and I was eager to give it a try.  I opened the tin to find brown coffee - while I already knew I would be disappointed because I already know I prefer Black coffee beans to brown. While it pulled a decent looking cup, I put it to my mouth only to find it did not match my tastebuds. One sip was all it took for me to hand it off to my husband.  So. My verdict here is, if you are like me and enjoy only black bean coffee DO NOT buy this product.  If you prefer brown bean coffee, give it a go. These jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up.  They came in a package without a jelly belly logo, the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo, and I dont really know if they were actually jelly bellys.  I got them as a gift, so I didnt try any of them, but it was odd giving a gift where it didnt seem like they were anything special, like Id bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something, big woop...so I was disappointed.  And because they were a gift I had no idea what they tasted like.  So were they really jelly bellys?  Who knows?  I felt silly giving them though. Good idea but the company should use a better soil compound.  Maybe darker.  Its hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry.  Present compound blows away when I water it.  Finally sprouted and Ill transpant to a regular top soil when it grows more.  At least with soil, you can tell when its dry.  Right now, I will give it small amounts of water weekly until that happens.  Very disappointed with this product. I bought two bags of these, thinking it was the same product that I used to buy in different packaging (light blue, with a see-through dog shape against a grass green background). Unfortunately, it was completely not the same thing! These treats were actually like jerky-- tough and brittle. I give my dog soft treats because he doesnt chew the damn things, and he choked on these horrible things; I had to toss them out.Note that the \"Zukes Jerky Naturals\" with the other packaging (http://www.amazon.com/Zukes-Jerky-Naturals-Beef/dp/B00008DFPY) have always been moist and soft, and Ive never had a problem with those. I suspect that this batch was not new packaging, as I had thought, but very old packaging; these may be the same treats I usually feed my dog, just having sat on a shelf for years. In any case, these were COMPLETELY different treats, and not safe to feed my dog. We have two cats and four dogs. The cats seemed to like this treat but the dogs turned up their noses at it. One of them, a Chiweenee, eats just about everything and he would not touch it. He tried it and left it laying on the floor. Under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the USA. I got the Lamb and Rice jerky today and it says on the package the Lamb comes from New Zealand. Thats a huge misrepresentation of this product on the product page. Very disappointed. This is a good decaf coffee, but Ive never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. Its extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess. Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. Im still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut.

Using the middle cup size on my Keurig coffeemaker, these k-cups make a weak cup of coffee... more like brown water. No taste, no nothing. I switched to the smallest size cup and its marginally better, but still barely drinkable. I wouldnt serve these to guests EVER. I cant wait to be done with these boxes of junk so I can order something with some taste. Please dont waste your money. this was terrible coffee Wolfgang Pucks Jamaicamecrazy, I received a partial refund but felt I should have gotten a full refund as I cant drink the coffee and had to throw it all away. Also had to pay shipping and should not of had to. I would like a response to this. I found this coffee to be great at first, but as I started having it more and more I came to detest it. On the large setting the coffee is WAY too watery. Also, the flavor is very, very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas.It is a pretty good mid-afternoon or evening desert coffee, but other than that it is kinda gross. I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.  It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more \"class.\"  This tastes artificial and it cant stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener.  Will not buy again! Really?  Who blends this stuff and decides that it is good?  Ugh.  I can sum this nastyness up in one quick phrase.  Stale airline coffee!  If you like that flavor, then you will love this one, if you dont like thin cardboard soaked, never washed the pot out, and the water came from a tin canteen, flavored coffee, then you wont like this one either!  I would give this zero stars if I could.  WOW, likely the worst cup of coffee that I have ever had.  I hope Wolfy reads this as his name is on the package and I expected more, now I know not to buy any of his signature products, awesome, thanks for saving me $$ next time!  The package says Extra Bold, but it doesnt taste extra bold.  Its almost like they put some ground instant powder in the mix to make it stronger. The coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt.  I cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt.  Will not order this again. Im amazed that people are happy with this product.  Im not a drinker of the dark brews, French roast or anything, but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee, this is completely tasteless.  The initial scent is delicious, too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee. To me this coffee was extremely bitter.  I dumped it out and made a different cup.  It made me afraid to try other WP coffees but I did like the WP Sumatra Kopi Raya.For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.My favorite k-cups are:Starbucks French RoastStarbucks Caffe VeronaStarbucks Pike Place RoastGreen Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran ReserveGreen Mountain Double Black DiamondGreen Mountain RevvGreen Mountain Dark MagicOther k-cups Ive tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold This Wolfgang Puck Coffee Jamaica Me Crazy is the worst coffee Ive ever had!I threw it out right away after one sip! It taste like all coconut flavoring.Hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. They should be fired! Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee... If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldnt believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emerils. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share Ill stick with offering The Coffee Peoples Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as Id be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices Ill not be duped again. Ill stay away from any of the other WP offerings. This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didnt like it either and I ended up throwing it out. Ok...TODAY 4/15 this company decided to put them up for sale at 12.50 per 24pk...  This advertisement was on SLICKDEALS.NETWell... Went to order and refreshed the page and in my cart was now 1 at 36 dollars???? so they sold one out of my cart.Next.... I waited 20 mins to see if it was a fluke and SD.NET started claiming dead link.Well upon refreshing again... they were now 44.95 for one 24 pack...Hey RIDICULOUS SELLER..... GET WITH THE PROGRAM ...IF THIS IS YOUR WAY OF RECOVERING QUICK MONEY...I THINK PEOPLE ARE MUCH SMARTER THEN THAT UPON PRESSING CONFIRM MY ORDER>..... ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO YOU FOR BEING SO UN-TECH-SAVY The worst!!! it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the Hazel Nut flavor at all!!!!!  Do not buy this product save your money!!!!! I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it cant be returned. I bought both the Creme Caramel and this Hazelnut kcup and I couldnt tell them apart even if my life depended on it... The flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too and unlike the Caramel one, this one has a nasty bitter aftertaste like the flavor is artificial.  Yeah, I know its artificial but I hate that it actually tastes like a chemical!  Yuk...This is one of those coffees you can serve to company who doesnt know good coffee or people you dont want to have come to your house any more as one cup of this and they wont be your friends after it!  It really is quite bad. this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe... its artificially flavored, and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it. My household hated it. Of course, that would be my problem if the description was accurate, but its not. Amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page. I purchased two of these and they arrived with the package split and the items all over the box. I contacted Amazon and they sent two more out, these also arrived with the packages open. Amazon was very courteous and professional as always, I cannot review the item itself because the packaging is so horrible that I have given up on trying again. SORRY, AS I STATED ON MY OTHER REVIEWS MY GERMAN BREED, G.SHEPH. IS VERY PICKY...AND HE JUST DID NOT CARE FOR THE SMELL OF THESE BEEF ROLLS, HE DID NOT EVEN CARE TO COME CLOSE TO TAKE 2ND SNIFF....SORRY, NO STAR!!! BUT IT TRIGGERED ME TO GIVE IT AS LEAST 1 STAR TO CONTINUE MY REVIEW. licorice  has  no  flavor very hard  to eat it was in a seal  bag  but  it  hard  not soft like other  licorice This batch was horrible.  Since most regular coffee were out of stock, I tried this one.  It tastes and smells awful.  Do not buy this flavor. The particular packages had an off taste. However, the seller gave me a complete refund and didnt even make me send them back. I have ordered this item before and they were fine. Hi, coffee doesnt smell or taste great. I recommend Senseo Vienna. Still have packages of \"Paris\" and nobody wanna drink it. Guess I just have to throw it away. They kept raising the price. The product was great and remained the same but they kept raising the price. This last order I have had enough and will be going back! If this was called \"Medium Roast\", I would give it 4 stars. Its a good coffee.But this is called French Vanilla Caramel, and this review is based on the products name.Let me say that vanilla and caramel are perhaps my favorite flavors... coffee, ice cream, candy, you name it... if its vanilla or caramel, I love it.With the exception of this.Wheres the vanilla? Wheres the caramel? And dont get me wrong: Im not trying to say that the flavors are too mild. Im saying that they are NON-EXISTENT. And therefore, based on the name, this coffee gets 1 star. After a few uses, this powder spoilt a cake. It has lost its raising power. It is still well within the expiry date and the container has been kept closed and in a dry place. Avoid this one. I plan to ask for a refund. I opened the box to find a huge mess of chocolate all over the tray. Chocolate was no better than Hersheys and worst of all, it is imported from Hong Kong. I dont care to eat food made in China after all their countless product safety issues. Look elsewhere This is the first review I have ever done, but I could not let this one go bye. This was the worst ever, save your money. I think Im not a green tea drinker.  This is pretty awful tasting stuff.  Glad I bought just one bag, because Im throwing it out. This huge bag of chocolates contained old (white and cracked) chocolates that were completely melted all over the inside of the bag!  Noone at work would even touch them since they looked so sad and gross... what a waste and disappointment!  Will be wary to ever purchase from this seller again My wife really loves O.N.E Coconut Water.  I thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some.  I ordered 6 cases of 12 ea.  The first problem occurred when case number one was sent back as undeliverable.  I guess a San Diego address would be undeliverable in Kentucky.  Of the 5 remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition.  All the cases were still sealed but 1 had 2 of the 33.8 ounce boxes split open and there were 3 other boxes in other cases that were stale (really had a rancid smell).  Therefore I cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket.  Works out better, just more time consuming and heavier.  It would have been nice knowing that the cases were in fact pretty flimsy.  My wife still loves the product. First off, I didnt purchase this product through Amazon, but at a local grocery store, so my review only reflects the product itself, not Amazon in any way.  I bought this last week never having tried coconut water before, but I heard good things.  The taste of it was almost like the smell of lawn clippings that had been damp and out in the sun for a long time.  Tasted off and had a faint mold smell to it.  I didnt know if it was supposed to taste like that or not as I never tried it before, but paying as much as I did I felt obligated to finish it off.  Ive been ill for about a week after drinking it.  I dont know if it was just a coincidence or the cause of it.  I did email customer service at O.N.E. the day I drank it asking if it was supposed to taste like that or if I got a bad batch, and they still havent replied to me. People watch out if you are buying this product online. Ive ordered 12 bottles of the O.N.E, I was expecting this to be same as what I bought from store but this seller disappointed me, The bottles have the seal broken and the taste of the coconut water is not what I expected, Im sure that this seller/ the person who packaged the bottles added water by breaking the seal. Ive wasted my money on this product, Ill never buy this online for a few bucks cheap rather than go to the nearby store and buy it.my rating for this product is 0/5.In short, Seal broken, Diluted and Not comparable with the one that I bought from store. Hi,I am very disappointed with the past shipment I received of the ONE coconut water. 3 of the boxes were leaking and the coconut water was spoiled.Thanks.Laks I bought these for my vegan father who LOVES the curry kale chips by Rhythm Superfoods (my 22 month old daughter, husband and I also like them)!Thought I would give him a new kale chip flavor--BBQ--as part of his Christmas gift. Although a different brand than we typically eat, they sounded good. First, I was disappointed to see these chips are not kale in its natural curly form but pressed into round, dog-snack-looking discs. Luckily I tried them before giving them. I spit it right out! Was it just me? My husband also tried one and couldnt finish even one chip.I have a pack of 4 that cannot be returned... what a waste of food and money! ...so you know I am serious. I would give it a 0, were it an option. I love Amazon - they have never let me down, so I am hoping they come through for me when I file a claim with them.The product was rock hard, so I followed the enclosed instructions and heated it even less than the recommended time in the microwave. It kneaded easily enough and smelled/ tasted good. When it came to rolling, I could tell immediately that this was going to be a challenge. Sure enough, it tore all over the place. Redo. I used cornstarch, the way I was taught, and it still stuck to every surface as if it were too warm or wet, yet cracked as if it were too dry. Nothing made it cooperate, so I lowered my standards and draped it anyway. Durring the two-foot trip from the rolling surface to the cake, it ripped in several places and the application to the cake ended in absolute disaster. No, I did not roll it too thin. Yes, I used cornstarch (even though the packaging specifically claims it is unnecessary.) It sucks. The end. This product was so easy to work with.  On 6/23/12 I made a little over 100 flowers for wedding cupcakes, the following day I did the same using a different color of Satin Ice. The flowers of both fondants were firm, I stored them in an air tight container. On 7/2/12 I opened the container of flower made with the Fondarific and they were soft.  The flowers made from Satin Ice were perfect. I left the container of Fondarific flowers open over night to see if they would harden up again, they turned out \"gummy\", you know, like chewed gum, which is probably less sticky than this mess.  I am so dissappointed in this product.  Fortunately I made my flowers early, I have time to purchase Satin Ice and make 100 more flowers.  I do not recommend this product. I was very dissapointed with this fondant. I decided to try it for the first time, and that was a mistake. They claim that the fondant can be rolled out thinner then most brands, so you can use less to decorate more. That is not true. Even just rolling it out to 1/8in it tends to tear. Once I finally got it on the cake to cover, it is very hard to smooth it around the cake. It is very sticky, the fondant smoother does not glide smoothly over it. All in all I will never buy this brand again, I am going to stick with Wilton. Fondarific usually has glowing reviews... everyone on the cake forums seems to love it.  My batch was either old or just crap.  Very disappointing.  Will go back to making marshmallow fondant.... cheaper and WAY easier to work with.  Also bought the black but didnt open it because the white was such crap.  Had to use it because I ran out of time to make MMF for the cake I was making... DUE TO THE FACT THAT I PRE-PURCHASED fondant to use.I love working with Fondant, and thought that maybe Id use something easier this time, but it wasnt.  Good luck with this.Taste however, was quite good. MY Fondarific Buttercream Wedding White Fondant, 5-Pounds IS as hard as concrete!!!!!!! I just received this today, I cant use it, obviously, I have a wedding on Saturday, what should I do? HELP! This a non return item, what should a customer do? I was excited to see that Amazon is selling 100% Kopi Luwak. However, these beans were a huge disappointment because they had no aroma and flavor at all. Im guessing that they sent stale beans because there was no roast date printed on the bag. I bought this to take a check mark off of the bucket list, but my wife and I had a cup of this and both of us immediately got sick with a headache and vomiting profusly. What made it worse its Christmas and this day is shot now. Were coming through it but Im sorry to say but my bucket list was almost over before it got started. Try if you want but its made us sick and almost in the hospital. This is a Christmas Id like to forget. There was no seal of any kind on jar. Cap had loosened slightly and some of the paprika had spilled out. Would not chance using an open jar so in the trash it went. I ordered  Smoke paprika, unfortunately i received regular sweet. I called and spoke with a gentleman, who promised to send me the smoke paprika and apologized for the mistake made. Until today (1 month maybe 2 later) still havent received anything or heard from the company. Very disappointed. the details say:Product Features:12 Blister PEZ Packs3 PEZ candy refills in each pack,Disneys Cars Pez AssortmentProduct Description:Cars PEZ dispensers featuring Lightning McQueen, Mater, Sally and Doc Hudson. Each is individually bagged and include two great tasting candy refills.I only got 6 blister packs and only got 3 of the 4 characters. Also the picture showed 12 packages. Obviously they put a \"6 dispensers\" in the title (I thought that to be a misprint) and took a 12 pack and busted it down and sent me half for the price that was for 12. RIP OFF!!! I was quite excited to try this product, so I bought 4 packs. We opened one, and I tested a half-tablet. No result. My wife tried the other half. Ditto. The next day, we tried a full tablet, letting it completely dissolve over the entire tongue. I found the tablets pretty tasty themselves, while my wife found them too chalky to enjoy. Anyway, again there was no effect with lemons, chili sauce, etc. Our daughter also had no discernible change in her taste of foods.Happily for me, the company is going to refund me for the other three packages. But I would have preferred that theyd worked. I was looking forward to bringing them out at an upcoming party. I guess everyones taste buds are different.  This product didnt work for me.  Every food item tasted as it should :-( Dissolved an entire tab on my tongue and was disappointed to discover that it had no effect on ANY of the foods that I tried. I bought my mberry pack from mberry.us online hoping to use it to curb my sweet tooth. I followed the directions to the letter, allowing the tablet to dissolve completely on my tongue. I then tried balsalmic vinegar - nothing happened to the taste at all except that my tongue burned a little. So I tried hot sauce - nothing happened again except that my tongue burned a lot. Then I tried regular vinegar - nothing happened again. I even tried taking a second tablet, but it still did nothing but slightly burn my tongue. HUGE waste of money. Super disappointing. DOES NOT WORK! Not much to say, other than the product solicitation is all hype! I carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the \"mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets\" and the results were about as miraculous as one of those potato chips baring the face of Mary Magdelene! Sorry \"Believers of Miracles\"... this is one that wont make \"The Tonight Show\"! I was excited about these and had organized a whole event for my fiancees birthday around these tablets.Placed an order well in advance, namely 3 weeks in advance.After two weeks of waiting, I received a notification that my order was being cancelled for some mysterious as yet to be determined problem. The email attempted to spread the blame between Amazon, its supplier and some mysterious unknown factor, ultimately taking no real responsibility for the blunder.Color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being, their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders.This to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the companys response was very wishy washy and lame. In my experience, when a company screws up (mind you it wasnt just my order, it was a whole slew of orders that got cancelled)they should own up and take responsibility thereby showing some integrity, rather than mutter some indecipherable mumbo jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem. I dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing.  I added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter, but it didnt make them taste good.....It makes really sour things slightly sweeter....but NO MIRACLE. Well I bought these to have a \"Food Tripping Party\" with my wife. I had a spread before us of lemons, limes, strawberries, blackberries, oranges, and grapefruit. We both started with half a pill each as per the reviews here. I then took a bite of a lemon. I guess is was sweeter but not by much, though I was able to eat it. It was like a sweet + tart food which I guess is because of the acid in the fruit. I then ate another half of pill because the instructions that came with the pills stated to take a full one. I tried again. It made the lemons bearable but not super sweet. You would not be able to eat an entire be happy. I went onto the other fruits and the same thing. You could still taste the tart with a sweet aftertaste. My wife said this, \"Well it makes it so you can eat lemons, but who wants to sit around eating lemons all day?\" Im disappointed BUT the price was cheap enough and it was a fun thing to do with my wife. Ill pawn these off on friends and see what they say. To all the people who threw parties and raved and raved about how everyone loved them, my guess is that they didnt want you to feel bad. It didnt work for me.  Maybe its because I couldnt get past letting the whole tablet dissolve because to me the tablet tasted like vomit. These tablets hardly work in comparison with the actual berries. If you want flavor tripping then buy a box of the Synsepalum dulcificum berries or grow your own plant instead of wasting money on the pill/tablets. In my opinion. My husband and I were excited to try them. We bought pineapple, beer, lemon, lime, hot peppers, cheese and wine. The only thing we noticed any difference in was the lemon and lime. The lemon was pretty easy to eat because it added some sweetness - it remained quite sour though. We each let one tablet dissolve on our tongue as directed so not sure what the problem was. I and a friend tried these tablets before sampling various kinds of foods wed seen suggested online, but noticed no effects whatever. We used them as suggested, then even tried multiple tablets at once. Maybe I got a bad batch or maybe we have unusual taste buds, but in any case it was very disappointing. Makes me think I should have tried the berries themselves instead. After reading several glowing reviews about this product, I decided to buy it and see for myself how great it is.After following the instructions, I taste tested a variety of items, that were suggested on the packaging. None of which seemed to have any affect. On lemons, I noticed a slight taste change, however the lemon was no sweeter.Bottom line; the product is over-hyped, and in my opinion, is not worth the buying. I know its definitely not something I will ever purchase again. I read all the positive reviews and thought Id give it try. First of all it tasted stale.  Secondly I had to use 5 spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it didnt taste like the chocolate. It tasted more like Olvatine.  For the young people out there, Ovaltine was drink in the 50s, Which I didnt like any better. We all have different tastes.  For my part I wont be ordering this again.  UPDATE: I bought the Milk chocolate at the same time and decided to try that.  It was delicious.  I cant explain the difference but Id recommend the Milk Chocolate just stay away from the one with the marshmallows. I ordered the No Sugar Added version. I usually like no sugar added or low sugar products - ice cream, yogurt, hot chocolate etc. But this one was terrible. Like the other reviewer, this tasted like ovaltine. I had to use like 5 spoons of the powder to get the taste. I dont know what to do with 5 other cans.. I will probably donate.. I love hot chocolate and am always trying new ones, but this was the absolute worst cherry hot chocolate I have ever tasted!! I was hoping it would be good so I bought 2 cans. After 1 cup, I threw both cans away. If you want a really great cherry hot chocolate, add 3-4 teaspoons of the cherry juice from a jar of maraschino cherries to your favorite milk hot chocolate. YUM!!! Add more if you use dark hot chocolate. The company does not operate properly I ordered the French Vanilla.  That is the selection I clicked on and I recieved the White Chocolate. They should contact a buyer BEFORE shipping a substitution. I bought some of this chocolate for my mother who cant have much caffeine. She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephens on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. Thats the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, its easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its \"food\". and the company who makes it basically said \"Sorry, but it sucks to be you\". So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use. This is a horrible step by POP to change the formula.  They now use cheap maltose (barley malt sugar - HIGH glycemic 105) in place of most of the honey, and only a miniscule amount of the herbs which were so effective in the original formula.  HUGE disappointment, and shame on POP for corporatizing and cheapening their once-outstanding products.As with the other reviewer, I once recommended this to everyone.  Now I will go out of my way to steer clear of recommending anything by Prince of Peace.  Try Source Naturals Wellness homeopathic cough formulas - theyre much cleaner and work pretty well. I have orderred Jeremiahs Pick Coffee Organic Breakfast Blend Whole Bean Coffee more than 5 times however the last lot I received with really bad quality. Lots of broken coffee beans and very oily. Hope the seller can check what happen...I may not try it again. First, the product pictured is not what you get.What you really get is are tiny packets called \"sticks\" suitable for flavoring bottled water. The box doesnt even say what size bottle it is sized for.Im not keeping it so I cant tell you how it tastes. The mushrooms that were sent were not labeled like the picture, they had the old red and black label. When I opened the can and tasted them the had a very metallic taste and the inside of the can was discolored so I threw them away rather than take a chance of making myself sick. There is a date code on the top of the can of 0303 which I have no idea what that means and I cant find any explination of this code online. I will not buy this brand mushrooms anymore. I am a mushroom lover and I have bought many large cans of mushrooms in the past and I have never had them taste like these did. I meant to order Anthony Bergs chocolates and got this one by mistake...yikes, not a good outcome.  The chocolate is poor and the gel-like liquor is worse...dont make the mistake that i made... Bottom line, this made my cat projectile vomit. Ive never had a problem with him eating Friskies before but, I knew \"Cheezy Craze\" just didnt sound right. It came as a sample in one of the larger bags. Not fun to clean up after partial digestion. My cats go crazy for the Party Mix and mainly the cheese flavor. It sells for $1.50to $1.89 a pouch in my local stores, so I was looking on amazon hoping to find a betterprice. I looked at this listing because of the price of $6.48, assuming it was for severalpouches, like most of the other listings here. But no number of pouches was listed and theonly indication comes from looking at the shipping weight: this ia apparently the pricefor a single pouch. This is a problem with amazon--quantities are not always postedand you can really get ripped off overpaying. I saw one review for Friskies cannedfood, where the reviewer thought she was ordering a multican pack for $12 but theactual number was not posted and she ended up receiving ONE can! I love chia, but I have gotten two different packages of this brand that were rancid.  The expiration dates were over a year away.  Amazon doesnt allow food returns, and Navitas said I would have to ship them the seeds for them to check before they would send me new ones.  I will still enjoy chia, but Ill avoid this brand from now on. I bought Nutiva organic chia seeds before, two pouches 14 ounces each - $16.24 with tax, this brand in one 16-ounce pouch $14.83. The quality and the taste are the same, but the latter one is WAY much more expensive. Buy Nutiva Organic Chia seeds, not Navitas. In terms of the taste, I usually toast mine and add them everywhere - cereal, yogurt, oatmeal, etc. Tastes great and full of fiber. I love the Nativa brand, however, they always seem to leave out very important details on their packaging.I heard so many praises about how much better the Chia seeds are than Flax seeds.Upon arrival I opted to use these in my salad as opposed to the flax seeds Ive been using.The Chia seeds caused the most horrible and painful bloating I ever experienced. Granted, I did use the full serving size, but since then I lowered the amount and STILL with even just a quarter of a teaspoon or less I get the bloating.I have since switched back to the Flax seeds which didnt wreak havoc on my intestinal tract.I am hoping I can find some way to use these seeds in the future because I hate seeing anything go to waste.My advice if you are set on trying the Chia seeds is to start out with a very low amount!!! And stick with that low amount until your stomach builds up a tolerance for these seeds. I bought this product not that many months ago and loved it BUT no longer buying this brand because it doubled in price! I bought it for $10 originally. Will buy another brand. You think youre doing something good for your kid when you invest a little more to get an organic formula.  Sadly, thats not the case here.  This is a horrifically constipating formula...lots of pain and straining, guaranteed.  Having to take measures to prevent this (offering juices, water, etc) is just not a sensible approach.Also, the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money, and they use a LOT of it.  With the same sweetness as country time lemonade, Similac Organics sucrose-based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes.  Check the NY Times article for more info on this.Bottom line: painful constipation in the near term, possible diabetes and certainly a sweet tooth in the future...no, thanks! we switched from the advance similac to the organic product thinking it would be better as we prefer organic foods ourselves. it was a disaster with our 2 month old baby getting constipated and progressively worsening her intake till she fell drastically below her calorie intake. we discontinued the product within five days and switched back to the previous similac and she is fine now. her feeding and calorie intake is back to normal RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!Martek advertises this formula on their website!\"Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted.

The patents explain that the oil is \"extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane.\"The patent for LifesARA states: \"genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid\" and \"extraction with solvents such as ... hexane.\" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane arent allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.Tragically, Marteks LifesDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Marteks petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted LifesDHA and LifesARA are no longer allowed in organic products.BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcomThe best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health. i ordered this on 8/29/10, and it didnt ship out until three and a half weeks later. its 10/12/10 and i still havent received it yet. next time, i plan to order from a merchant who can fulfill it in a reasonable timeframe.as far as the product is concerned, i do like that the similac liquid formula in the 32oz size doesnt contain BPA. i was really upset when i researched and discovered that the single-use ready-made liquid containers and large powdered containers both contain BPA. i would expect more diligence from similac to be BPA-free in all of their packaging. My child was exclusively breastfed for 4 1/2 months and I gradually introduced Similac Organic formula to supplement (my breastmilk started to dry up).  She found this was so much easier to eat she gave up on me by 5 1/2 months.  By the time I completely stopped nursing she was so constipated from the formula that I switched.  She winced and cried and worked so long to just produced a hard ball the size of ping pong ball.  It was horrible!  I realized I was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full-formula.  I say switch.... We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, \"Is my child really constipated?\"Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased \"motility,\" we say)  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces  * a combination of the above two factors  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesnt allow easy evacuation  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passageBreast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the babys rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesnt do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.TopBottle fed infants are \"a whole nother story.\" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac® that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.The young infants colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents dont realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.TopTreatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.  * I use a lot of Karo® corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses dont use it properly, get poor results, and dont recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).  Before scolding me about \"the risk of botulism\" from corn syrup, please see:  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: \"Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember\"  \"In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.\"  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just wont come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just dont eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac®, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)TopMyths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo®, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.Top This is a great product... my baby loves it. I especially like the smooth liquid formula versus the powder since the powder never seems to dissolve properly.I am, however, rating this low because of the SELLER... $55 is RIDICULOUS! This product normally sells for $25-$32. But they are jacking up the price because there is a shortage of the liquid formula due to the powder recall.YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED AMAZON!!!! This is food for a BABY! Makes me ill. Do not buy this product.  You will not be doing your infant any favors.  If at all possible, you should be breastfeeding.  (I know its not always easy or convenient.)  If you cant then in my opinion the best formula is Earths Best and even that is disappointing.  Basically, they dry cows milk and remove all the natural nutrients then \"fortify\" with synthetic vitamins/minerals.  Pathetic.  Just buy whole organic milk, raw if possible.  There are recipes online to make it closer to human breast milk.  Sorry to be so matter of fact.  Im losing patience for all these evil corporations capitalizing on the \"green\" movement.  OH and by the way the second ingredient in this garbage is sugar!!! Good way to start the diabetes/obesity while theyre young! I got a call from my mother-in-law last night thanking me for her birthday present I ordered here. She thanked me for the surprise and also had to comment how terrible they tasted. She asked me if it was supposed to be a joke on her. I said no and felt bad a 93 year old lady ate some bad jelly beans.Wont buy again,Steve Baker Be careful if you have a chocolate allergy.  The last box I purchased has cocoa powder as the ingredient and the cones are brown.  I know previous boxes did not contain cocoa powder and were a normal cone color.  The distributor should market these as chocolate cones and not try to pass them off as something else.  Note:  Be especially leary since this seller doesnt list ingredients. I like Japanese soups and just love the similar products from San-J (also available from Amazon -- get those, theyre 5-star!).This Miso-cup brand is terrible. I cant tell you more than this is just yicky. I wish there was a zero-star rating!I didnt finish the first cup even (but Id already tried and re-tried another Miso-cup flavor and hated it). Therefore, I only used one envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cups different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. It was this flavor, in particular, that I was most interested in trying for variety. But now I know that ALL the Miso-cup brand are equally dreadful!!!I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!! I was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee. I have purchased Blue Mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great. But this was totally unsatisfactory. It had a mildewed flavor to it like it had been stored for a long time in a warehouse that was damp or moldy. For the money I paid for it I was quite displeased and will NEVER buy from them again. My son had this Jablum roasted and ground coffee brought back from Jamaica and paid a lot for it.  I have drunk blue mountain for years when I can but this was shocking.  It tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it.  It was definitely off.  He bought 5 bags and every one we tried was the same.  I would never buy another.  We had bought another brand in a tin from Jamaica which was fine.  I think this is a con.  You get all the rubbish about it being tested in Jamaica, well I dont know who tests it but definitely not someone who likes good coffee.  I just dont understand how people say its any good. Maybe having paid so much for it its like the emperors new clothes. While in Jamaica, my wife and I drank Blue Mountain Coffer every day and loved it.  We even went on a bike tour of the Blue Mountains, and purchased some coffee.  It came in a plain clear plastic bag, and we could see the darkness of the roast.  We enjoyed that coffee.In Ocho Rios, we bought some bags of JABLUM.  You cant see the darkness of the roast, and all you can smell is the burlap bag.  When we opened it up, it was a very light roast, not much fragrance, and once brewed, the coffee tasted a lot like dirt.  We were very disappointed. I recently ordered the 16 oz., 3 Pack.  When my FedEx order arrived on December 26, 2008 there were only two 16 oz. bags contained in my order.  I would like my missing 16 oz. bag to be sent to me or at least be refunded 1/3 of my $105 charged price. I dont get all the hype over this coffee. Not much of a head on it. Doesnt taste that great. Whats the big whoop? Not what I expected at all, there is no punch to these chips like I thought there would be. Not spicy or hot but rather just disgusting. The flavor is off and the after taste is god awful. I ate one corn chip and decided I did not care for them so I ate something else to get the flavor of poop out of my mouth, because that is what these chips taste like, and I can still taste these poo chips.  I will not be buying these chips again at all.  There blue corn chips are really great, but the so called red powder they put on these is just so off. A terrible product we follow the intructions and did not get the the pork rinds.  We only got pieces of pork skin Too salty. But that was not even the worst of the problems. It has a weird texture (I cooked it perfectly) and tastes horrible. If you havent eaten pork rinds before, please stay away. Even the worst popcorn tastes better. Lowreys has changed its microwave pork rinds. I used to love them. The last order I received was put up in a generic paper container with really flimsy cellophane wrapping. There is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever. The taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds. As I said, I used to love the product. I will buy no more Lowreys microwave pork rinds. Giving the other 17 bags of these to the local food shelf just seems too cruel, better to throw them away.I dont know what good the popping does except make them sort of hot. Theyre too salty, have a hideous flavor, taste nothing like pork rinds. They dont even taste as good as _bad_ pork rinds. Theyre also loaded with chemicals I want to avoid (probably part of the source of the hideous flavor). I dont know if I got a bad batch or something, but I couldnt get these to cook right. I followed the instructions and after about two minutes, the bag stoped expanding. I opened it and found everything badly burnt. the next bag I waited about one and a half minutes. I opened it and found half the chips uncooked. I never could find a time that either left some uncooked or some burnt. (I shook the bags and scattered the chips inside them well before microwaving each time) I received my shipment today, and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings. Only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly. I even put the unpopped on a plate as someone suggested and nothing. I carefully followed directions for each bag. If I could rate this, a zero I would. Ive bought this product many times and this time (11/10) they are old or defective.  The bags dont puff up and rinds are flat, stale & burn when cooked.  Ive tried different time settings and in different microwaves.Im very dissapointed as this is a product Ive been ordering for years.  Guess Ill have to call them and complain. Yuck, these do not taste good and they are quite tough. Better off buying the bags of rinds already prepaired. too much MSG gives it a nasty salty after taste.  i basically gave them away. OK but too Salty.  they should make a low sodium version.  The spicy is better. Could not get the bags to \"pop\" any edible pork rinds.  I tried several bags with no results.  I finally had to throw them out.  I was very dissapointed with this product. I hated the flavor of this product, I ended up just giving it away at work who ended up giving it away to there friends. I normally rate whatever items I buy but rarely offer words of advice. Well, these things changed my mind. I love pork rinds. Usually I buy a tub of them from Sams, but since Im the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, \"Hey, thats the perfect solution!\". Its a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. Theres enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldnt be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth. Im still shuddering from it. If you like the taste of feet, go for it. If not, Id suggest heading to Sams to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love. Lowreys Bacon Curls Pork Rinds: 1.75 ounce microwave bags are loaded with 350 milligrams of salt, Thats all I tasted, A pinch of salt would have been better. The bags catch fire in my microwave and that leaves most un-popped and extremely over-salted.  This product is inferior to other brands I have tried. A warning should be placed on the item description because this product contains Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), a dangerous excitotoxin which is problematic for many people. There is no indication in the item description that this is the case. I fully agree with another reviewer that this item also is so extremely salty that it cannot be consumed. The MSG also heightens the very salty taste. This item did puff up very nicely in the microwave, but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all 18 packages had to be thrown out. For that reason, I am surprised at the many excellent reviews of this product. Amazon.com gets an A+++ for their wonderful handling of this problem. Horrible \"hemical\" taste.Extremely salty !!!!!!This was a complete waste of money,after the first bag I will have to throw the whole box away !!!!!!!! I tried to \"cook\" 6 different bags of these.  Only a fraction of product \"popped up\".  The ones that managed to pop tasted overly salty and had an unusual flavor.  Unfortunately, they were not returnable, so the rest will be going to the trash.  Waste of $$$. I ordered this product - Lowrys Pork Rind - and received it promptly - within two days.  I have not been able to pop one bag!  They all stay flat - nothing works.  My microwave is not the problem as I cook lots of other things in it.  Looks to me that the product is not longer any good, by the comments.  They may have started out great, but it NO LONGER IS WORTH BUYING! This is my first time and I cant eat them they are all small hard peaces with only a frw puffie ones. Is there something wrong with my batch? I cant eat them or they would break my teeth am I doing something wrong I only cook them 1 min. These pork rinds contain MSG which is not stated on the listing.  Deceptive listing for this product.  Will not purchase again.  Shame on Amazon for wasting my money. They were very salty and seasoned with a seasoning that my family and myself did not like.  I shared with co-workers and they did not like them either.  We still have the balance and hate to pitch them but if we can not find someone who likes them that we can give them to we will.  I think they were awful I was so excited when I heard about this product. I love pork rinds. But these have a nasty chemical smell and they really dont taste good at all. Dont waste your money. I actually threw the remaining 17 packages away. They REALLY SUCK!!!! After reading all the positive reviews, I was really looking forward to finally getting a very low carb (somewhat low calorie) snack that I can work into my low carb living.  Ive had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good, so I expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand.  Wrong.  I was first disappointed with the texture.  After following the instructions to microwave from 1-2 minutes, some (about 1/4) were crispy, but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth?  Perhaps I didnt cook long enough, so 2nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy, but more burnt and chewy ones.  But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste.  Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didnt really have a lot of flavor.  They were salty (which is to be expected),but thats really all the flavor you get.  So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or cant find any in a near by store), this may work for you.  It  works out to about $1.00 a bag, so Im not totally disappointed as my dog loves them.  By the way, my dog gives them 5 stars. These pork rinds by Lowerys suck.I have tried to leave a review, but it appears that Amazon.com has their heads as far up their a**es as Lowerys.  I dont expect to see this posted. This is a great idea but just like baking a cake...you cant do it in a midrowave. I got these for my dad from his wish list.  He thought they would be spicy and flavorful but they just tasted like cumin and had a funky smell.  The box came with 18 individual bags but after you open one bag, its impossible to even want to put yourself through that again.  They are nasty!!!  Avoid them at all cost!!  Yuck!! Lowreys Bacon Curls Pork Rinds: 1.75 ounce microwave bags are loaded with 350 milligrams of salt, Thats all I tasted, A pinch would have been better, or no salt at all. I am a lover of pork rinds so i was really looking forward to eating fresh ones, neathers to say they dident cook in 5 mins like it says it would and if you put it in that long most would burn to a crisp by that time, another thing that really dident appel to me is that the taste is like they poured tones of salt on them before they packaged them.... i wanted to eat pork rinds NOT salt, if i wanted to salt i would just get it from the salt in my seasons cabnet...very disappointed... I recieved my bacon crisps. The price is OK, but I did not order hot & dont know how to change my subscription. Being a gluten sensitive individual, I was lured into a false sense of security when I read the simple ingredients on this Amazon info page.Because I didnt first do my homework, and read the labels before I began consuming these, I ended up having a massive asthma attack.  Just wanted to let everyone who has these sensitivities/allergies to avoid this product. This is my fourth order of these pork rinds and Im not sure whats up, but somethings really amiss.  The bags are leaking some kind of grease and dont fluff up during the microwave process.  I used to love these, so hopefully this is just a bad batch.  If not, then Lowreys needs to look into this and fix whatever has happened to a once great snack. I heated these up in the microwave, and they do not microwave evenly. some will be burnt and hard as a rock when others will be just right. since you dont get very many in one bag, and since about 1/3 dont cook right, you barely get any pork rinds and throw the rest away. Maybe I am not cooking them right, but i followed the directions... first, the good news:  YES, these are really good.the bad news: They are loaded with monosodium glutamateOf course, this wasnt listed on Amazon as one ofthe ingredients.This is a good item if youre not sensitive toMSG--Now I have to go to the 7-11 and buy the fried porkrinds to feed my addiction. Someone at work cooked these and the smell is now making everyone sick. Smells kinda like puke. Hopefully the smell does not last overnight. Not recommended. For starters, Im not salt or msg averse. I enjoy salty food like chips, jerky, and bacon. However, these pork rinds are ridiculously salty tasting. To give you a better idea of what Im referring to, Kettle Chips Sea Salt variety have 55 mg of salt per 1/2 oz of chips. Lowreys pork rinds have 310 mg of sodium per 1/2 oz serving. Thats roughly six times the salt content of a food considered relatively salty by most people. I read a review on here saying that they were too salty and decided to order them anyway thinking the reviewer was some salt hating baby. Boy, was I mistaken. I wish I hadnt ordered these. Terrible. Half of the rinds dont cook and the ones that do are gummy and shrink. Contacted Lowreys about the defective product but they failed to respond. Wow, I had high hopes for a great addition to my low carb diet, but these rinds were very disappointing.  Tried several bags, but could not get the cooking time right.  Taste was dreadful, texture downright rocky.  I guess Ill stick to off the shelf rinds.  Wont be getting these again.  Cant recommend, and would warn of anyone asking for my opinion. When cooking according to instructions in microwave it keeps making popping noises and eventually it pops really loud and flies up and spills all over the place at about 1:15 secs in my microwave, WTF? It has done it to me three times in a row, then I tried it in my sisters microwave and had the same exact problem. Im not sure this stuff is even safe! Kind of  a ripoff.  I bought the theater box instead of the 5 piece candy bar version and that turned out to be a big mistake.  Each box has only 8 or 9 pieces and they are randomly filled so you are not guaranteed even 1 piece of each flavor.  One box had 6 green pieces and 3 black.  A better value is 20 pack of the original 5 piece bar.  This theater box is sold by weight (4oz) and not volume.  The box is about 90% empty- Ripoff! This company is a sponsor of the Rush Limbaugh radio show.  This means that Proflowers pays for and profits from Mr. Limbaughs hate speechs against women and non-Caucasian people. Normally I buy the Fruztio Freeze Dried Apricots made by Crispy Green Co. and they are DELICIOUS- but the store I was getting them from was out of stock for a very long time. So, I decided to try the cantaloupe since I like fresh cantaloupe...how bad could they be?My only choice was a large multi-pack bag, so I forked up the money with high hopes.  I tore into the bag, appreciating the single serve sized bags inside. I opened one up and took a bite. Blech! yuck! These tasted like green, under-ripe canteloupe! I was hoping for that super sweet-I could eat this whole melon- sort of flavor....but no.These were so bad that I threw the whole multi-pack away, and thats saying A LOT, because Im very frugal with my food purchases. I just knew I would NEVER eat the rest of them. Wish I could give a better review, but i cant.But I do recommend the apricots that I mentioned....they are super flavorful and delicious if you love that tart apricot flavor! I bought this based on the rave reviews posted previously -- but one of the main ingredients is MSG. Theres gotta be a way to make a good BBQ rub thats not loaded with the stuff, which gives me and my wife nasty headaches....... Gold Prince has made a terrible mistake.  There are two products.  COLDAID and FLUAID.  THey are different formulary.  Unfortunately they display Fluaid picture on the Amazon website and their own website but the words are COLDAID.  THere is a separate product for Coldaid.  Regardless -- if you order the FLUAID on AMAZON you will get the COLDAID...the picture is not the product...the words under the drop down menu are worthless...as they all default to the same product COLDAID.  If you want FLUAID, which is the superior product, dont buy it from AMAZON or off of the sellers website.  It is a mistake.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P936UK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldnt be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star. I ordered this product thinking it was going to come in a box of 24 (as it is described in the product description). I was a little unsure of whether or not this could be too good to be true, but when I saw that the weight of the item was marked as 6.1 lbs and the shipping/handling was $8 I felt pretty confident that I would be receiving the 24 count box that I thought this to be. When I received the package there was only ONE bone in it. So pretty much I spent $10 on ONE bone that I could have gotten at the store for $3. Dont make the same mistake as me! VERY poor product description by Ozbo! Love this cereal, but I buy  a 35 oz box at Costco for $7,49 and sometimes am offered it with a $2 /box coupon. Its too high here The 4 pounds of sliced meat itself are contained in a single cardboard box; no vacuum seal or even plastic wrap.  That box is placed in another box that is lined with styrofoam sides, styrofoam peanuts, and three frozen \"ice\" paks.  It was shipped FedEx 2 Day (thats what the label says), not Overnight or next business day, which begs the question, what exactly did the $52 in shipping charges for 4 lbs of meat and minimal packing materials actually go towards?  I think I know, and it wasnt shipping.Years ago \"Grecian Delight\" (the brand on the box) was sold in a local supermarket chain in Gyro Kit boxes - each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat, one pita, and a small container of tzatziki sauce.  I loved them, but I havent seen the kits in decades and was happy to find a way to once again stock the freezer with gyros-in-waiting.The gyro meat itself, which I have ordered before, tastes just like ... gyro meat!  As I said, I love gyros, but theres no place nearby where I can drop in and enjoy one.  So I have ordered the product in the past, but in this case, Ive ordered for the last time.Ive gotten the individual 1 lb vacuum packets before 3 at a time and theyve arrived frozen or nearly frozen. Not so this box.  The meat was not only thawed, it was only slightly cool. Im afraid Im going to be throwing it out.  Too risky.  For $52 shipping charges, it should have arrived in perfect condition. Overnight. I wont make this mistake again.  I cant afford to. This soup is very very sweet.  They left out the salt but it is full of sugar.  There is 14 grams of sugar per serving with two servings in a can.  Too sweet for me.  Also there is dairy butter in it so it is not vegan or for someone with dairy allergies. This is awful.  So, I got out the pots and pans and made a great no salt, little sugar and no butter fat tomato Soup using fresh tomatoes.  Tastes much, much better than this Tomato Soup! This is for the Health Valley Tomato Soup No Salt Added, 15 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12).  I purchased this specifically for a person with heart problems.  One of the problems with canned foods is too much sodium, so the No Salt Added is a good feature.  Another problem is cholesterol content.  The ad for this product states 0 mg cholesterol, which is a false statement.  Apparently the supplier did not update the ad when Health Valley changed their recipe for their No Salt Tomato soup and is now adding cholesterol.  The cans I received have a \"NEW\" on the label, which the can shown in the ad does not.  This is an honest mistake on the sellers part, but he should correct it, and he should list the true contents. This is not the product I received.  They changed the product.  It now has chunks of tomato in the soup.  This is not what I wanted. Actually I cant remember a time when I tasted anything so bad. I really could not believe it was meant to be eaten. Cannot imagine anyone liking this.  It did give me a good example for my daughter why it is important for her to take her health seriously. If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal. I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them. I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesnt take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  Ive been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so Im familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products Ive tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing Ive tasted.  Its not terrible, but its bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take. It is okay.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one. I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I dont find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn. The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little \"stuffing\" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause its a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found \"none\" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF \"STUFF\" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGSESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, ITS GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S. Even with small containers, they dont fill them up.  These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares?  Or how about the cereal ploy, they were filled at the factory but settled in transport.Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings? Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldnt keep it in or down. What a mess. Weve moved on. Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste. It is only for people who like herbal taste. I dont. The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2\" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a littlemore bang for your buck and have more flavor. Ive been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box.  Ive always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes.This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse. Yes, its probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if youre looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.Now youre NOT sensitive to caffeine, then its a great buy. Its not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. Its not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy! This product has a strong after-taste of Crayola crayons!I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes.  Upon opening the plastic container, the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room, and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it.I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased.To date, my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans.  The flavor is fantastic.  However, they do not supply a gallon-sized tub,and Dr. Mercola has the best product in that size category. My cat will go for a day, probably longer, havent tryed it, but hell walk right by this stuff every time, even when I know hes hungery. ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST. I swear hed rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it!! I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I dont know why these were different.Will never buy these chips from here again. I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor. I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that! It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Wont order this brand again. Great chips otherwise. I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...its annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite. Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy. Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat. I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they were packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say Ill never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.M. Martin Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar, i doubt you will like these chips.  These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.  The brown chips are especially bad, besides being salty and sour, they also taste overcooked and burnt.  Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste, you will not like these chips.I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste, so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty.  But normal people, please do not try this at home. If you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely arent for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you Ive tried ALL S/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bobs and Zapps Arent bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch, but if youre looking for S/V flavor these have \"just a touch.\" I dont know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side.One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lays Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lays Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock.These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique. There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, youd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I dont think Ill buy these again. The \"best by\" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October. The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed \"ginger with attitude\" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They arent that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.Here are the original and new ingredient listings:Original IngredientsSelect Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.New IngredientsPotatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extractIm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  \"Great Taste Naturally\" from their bags as I dont consider maltodextrin to be very natural.Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing! I guess theres no telling what will tickle the palate.  Im a huge Tabasco fan, and I love unconventional snacks.  But these dont taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce theyre made from; I didnt find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12. I did not like these potatoe chips. Its hot, and sweet, with an overwhelming taste of garlic. Its also a bit salty. Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of \"Yeast Extract\".It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for organic it just seems more deceptive. Well, I opened it and it is grayish sticky mess. Im so mad at myself for wasting my money, and not trying to make it from scratch at home. Which would probably end up better and cheaper. Oh well, live and learn! My husband and I were very disappointed in this coffee, very weak, watery cup of coffee. A definite waste of $13.00. this isnt as easy as it looks, doesnt came with enough yellow frosting, and the frosting doesnt stick very well. My 5 year old did like making it though. I was disappointed in this product because I thought it would be bigger.Also, it did not come with enough icing. I had to use my own. The whole idea of a Spongebob Ginger Bread Pineapple is really great, but the sticker that says \"Use By\" Has a 10 JN 16 date on it. If thats 2010- this is not good! I think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration, but my son is going to want to eat it.  The least the seller could do is to check the expiration date! Its right on the front of the box! Not happy at all!!! Trident \"Strawberry Twist\" sugarless gum is very disappointing, both in taste and consistency. The strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and, though I guess it is a good thing, not very long lasting. The gum also gets \"stringy\" fairly quickly.I chew a lot of gum, but will not be buying this flavor again.Not Recommended!CFH I cant eat these oats, they have a funny taste to them.  My kids also think they taste funny.  My husband thinks they are OK, so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own! I think the Pocky did not get stored rightly. The chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick, and doesnt taste as it should. Many of them stick together, and whenever I want to split them up, it just becomes very messy. Now I need to clean up my desk every time after I have it. The individual Pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped. I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens (dairy, soy, nuts) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions.  Unfortunately, these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry.  I threw them away.  I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free. I was extremely disappionted when I opened my shipment of Enjoy Life On The Go Bars (Very Berry, Carmel Apple, and Cocoa Loco). The boxes are now a plain, generic design..you know, the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper. I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home. Guess what?! Cheaper ingredients! Next, I taste-tested, and let my 3 year old help. He wouldnt eat the new ones...and I cant blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product. I was wrong. In summary, these are way too expensive to be made with low-quality, unpalatable ingredients. The first ball worked pretty well, it just looked a little beaten up.  Since then, ~half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water (all of them do after sitting for a bit).  If you dont mind the rate of failure, the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time (especially considering that it is white tea). I usually make my babys food.... its so easy, steam fruits & veggies and puree.... but sometimes I dont have enough time to cook and I buy Earths Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didnt like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldnt eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldnt recommend this flavor! I did not care for this product at all, I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school. I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree. I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hives..Um, how about NOT.  It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful.  Luckily, a co-worker of mine loves this stuff (reminds him of his grandmother) and I gave it to him.  Yucky, yucky stuff. These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety, which can be hard to find.One thing to keep in mind though, is the expiration or \"best by\" date.  For example, if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June \"use by\" date, it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you.  Since theyre roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.Amazon doesnt seem to specify \"use by\" dates for the food products they sell, so its a gamble for the purchaser.  Im assuming that Amazon wont ship stuff that has \"expired\", but they probably ship out the oldest stock first, and the \"use by\" date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice. I have to admit, I was a sucker for the large quantity, 12 oz, when shopping for hot sauces ...but now seeing the size of the bottle, it reminds of wing-sauce bottle sizes.  Plastic bottle.  It does have a convenient squirt top.  But overall, not very hot or tasty, and made mostly from jalape&ntilde;os.  If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought it:JalapenosWaterVinegarBrown SugarLime JuiceFish SauceCilantroHabaneroGarlicSpice BlendSaltPotassium SorbateXanthan Gum Ive been craving some deer jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try. This one was very sinue and a little too sweet for my taste. Not going to buy again. Im still on my search for the salty dry version im after On a trip to Italy, muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and I loved it.  Imagine how excited I was when I saw that Kellogs sold this product.  What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.\"Real\" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend \"time-to-mushiness.\")  And certainly only the Kellogs product contains HFCS.You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bobs Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I havent tried Familia (but Im not crazy about the idea of the \"fruit flakes\"), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellogs, but Im willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.Im surprised Quaker doesnt sell a muesli product...  Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., youd think it would be a natural fit for them. Recently purchased this cereal assuming it would contain nothing but healthy ingredients, then I read the label and discovered it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup. They claim this product is \"unadulterated\", which would make you think \"oh! sweet! its going to be the BEST, because nobody elses coconut oil says its \"unadulterated\".  I checked out their website, and for those of you who dont know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If theyre not cold pressed, it means theyve been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:\"\"Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.\"\"Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as \"unadulterated\" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.Im sorry if my review offends some, but if youre going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.\"\"What makes Nutivas virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutivas approach preserves as much of the oils natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.\"\"If you dont care about how its processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.Thank you for your time.-AmyPS. I used to be one of those \"organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think youre more special than anybody else?\" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my sons allergies and intollerances. Theres more to it than \"oh its more expensive, so its just making me feel special because I can afford it.\" No. Theres WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. Its a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier. If you live healthier, even though it costs more, in the long term youre saving money because you are healthier. So that means less doctor visits, less expensive (and nasty harmful) medications, etc. The Good:Walker shortbread cookies are my favorite, I love them.  I bought the highlanders and each set of cookies came individually wrapped with two cookies each.  If this were the end of it, a five star review.The Bad:Unfortunately, Amazon shipped them in a box that was about the same size as the container they came in from the Walkers cookie company.  After UPS was through with the shipment, my cookies were reduced to crumbs.  I contacted Amazon about this problem without ever receiving a response.  Since I bought these \"Shipped and Sold by Amazon\", I wont be purchasing these cookies from Amazon again. I ordered both the beef and Turkey flavors. My dogs would not even take these in their mouths. Both flavors were  very dry and had no real aroma to them. Try a small quantity first. i  donated the entire order to the Humane Society. After reading all the good reviews on these chips I have to admit I was disappointed. Perhaps I just ended up with a bad batch, but I could barely taste the vinegar and there seemed to be far too many burnt (and I mean BLACK) chips in these bags. Hopefully the other flavors are better, but Im going to stick with other brands from now on. The flavor combination of the ketchup chips was very good.  However, the coating was applied so heavily that the chips were gritty, and thickly encrusted with it. The flavoring grit coated my lips and mouth with grit and crumbled and fell off all over my clothes.  Messy and unpleasant.  Needs lighter flavor coating. I like the fact that this vanilla flavor has no alcohol in it so i could add it to my babys pancakes.  It does not taste the same to me as the regular stuff.  It is rather bland in my opinion. I ordered three of the trays (being a date nut) and found that two were old or stale. I admit to not checking the out-of-date on the exterior package, but still - dried out fruit.?! The last tray was fresher, but the experience was soured at that point. Im disappointed. I dont know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime, but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough. I remember well the \"Beer Nuts\" I used to savor. Those were the days of the big Redskin type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang I remember so well. These nuts I now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of \"Beer Nuts\" in any way. Yes, there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real. Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive Spanish peanuts. In short, I would just ask \"Beer Nuts\" ... What happened? Ya know, when youre on a gluten-free diet, you YEARN for those forbidden treats - like licorice! (and malted milk!) Realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future, we need to alter our expectations for this treat.I had tried this companys raspberry laces and strawberry laces - pretty good, although not easy to chew (think bubblegum).  Not REAL licorice you understand, but pretty doggone good as an alternative.So I thought I try these too - how bad could they be?  I found them pleasant to chew - not tough at all.  But the taste?  Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.So Im stuck with 11 packs.See if you cant find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out.  Your tastes may be different than mine, and you might enjoy them. This stuff sounded perfect...way too much red dye and no taste according to me and my 3 friends who tried it...kind of salty.  Basically, I would stay away from it.  I am tempted to toss it out, but paid too much to feel right about it... Caviar taste awful. Maybe its because I bought from a cheaper brand or maybe because cavier is just bad no matter who you buy it from or how much you paid for it? Why do people like to waste money on these things? This is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside.  There is very little taste and very little chicken.  It is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starch.It is not repulsively bad, if you want a light, convenient snack.The Chef Boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial, and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid, which comes away easily.  With these Hormel Compleats, you have to pierce the top first, and then peel it off afterwards, which is not so easy, especially as it is hot. the taste isnt good, at least isnt good for Japanese and Chinese.Its taste is basically sort of American Japanese taste.Plus the price isnt competitive.Id suggest Asians never buy it. The noodles for this product are what make me gag.  I am not a fan of this meal at all and I &lt;3 Asian food.  For those looking for a delicious snack who are not already 100% vegan - I would either A) go try 1 first or B) skip buying this package as it is not delicious. makes nasty loose poo! the dry food does the same thing. ive tried the adult version and the puppy version and both gave my adult dog and my puppy super soft and stinky stools. I have purchased locally many other flavors of Da Vinci syrups, and ordered blueberry online to try it, because it isnt available locally- and I love blueberry! Well, this was a disappointment to me- very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor; not to mention I paid 4x what I would pay locally.#very disappointed I simply dont like it. It is easy to prepare, but when I eat it, I feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients. I cannot even finish one fourth of it..... We enjoy A Taste of Tais Peanut Noodles... they rock.  That peanutty flavor...mmm... so we decided to try these... um, Ginger, not so much. Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor, and the ginger is a bit overpowering.Take this review in stride though, if youre a Ginger lover (and Im not talking Gilligans Island here), then these may be right up your alley.  Just a bit outside for me, though (if I may mix my metaphors). Thanks for the egg tip, it works very well and really helps this product.  Nevertheless, I ended up giving away three of the six containers because I was not thrilled with the nutritional information. I had recently tried a similar product from Trader Joes and, not having a TJs around me presently, I decided to try this more readily-available variation.  I didnt really like this thing too much.  For starters, there is too much packaging for my liking.  Too many things to throw away.  And I agree with a previous reviewer that theyre kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but its kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joes only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and youre done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didnt like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didnt have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things... I had high hopes when I ordered this tea, as years ago in San Francisco I used to buy a lovely rose black in Chinatown which was my favorite tea ever. Unfortunately, this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine. I prefer the opposite, a full-bodied tea I can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof.  But for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch, this might be a good choice. I was giving my shihtzu the Fromm Adult Gold dog food. She didnt seem to want to eat it though so I thought I would try something different. I found the Harmony Farms and thought Id give it a try. She actually liked it. Its cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldnt believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasnt as soft. This kibble did not do well for her. I bought two bags of PopChips at Whole Foods (Original and Barbeque)and loved them.  When I went to Amazon to order lots more, I liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones, which Id consume too quickly.  I knew I was taking a risk but when the order came, I really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment.  In addition, only the Original and Barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts; the others were all 3.  I still like PopChips but will only buy bags of the flavors I know I will enjoy eating and not have to choke down.  I recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order. I bought these and tried each flavor. I could not even finish any bag but the barbecue. I really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross. And the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me. HOw is this the #1 best-selling item? Amazed. Anywho to each his own! Godbless and enjoy. But if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind! Very tasty chips( ORIGINAL AND OTHER FLAVORS ),but ones with salt flavor way too salty.Not sure who likes so much salt in chips.. I hate to type this, because there are so many people that really enjoy this product, but take a look at the ingredients in this so-called \"all-natural\" product. I have the cheddar cheese flavor right in front of me, so that is the only flavor I can vouch for right now.  About halfway down the list of ingredients youll see \"yeast extract.\" Unfortunately, this is the new MSG.  Many people are still unaware of this fact and \"natural\" food companies are taking advantage.  It is a chemical flavor enhancer whose potential side effects are very scary.  Google \"MSG yeast extract\" for yourself, or check out [...]. These are to potato chips as Pringles are to chips; as instant coffee is to brewed coffee; and Stephen Baldwin is to Alec Baldwin - same family but scant resemblance.  So Id buy a single, small package at your grocers and try them out.  Not for everyone, and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys.  Even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate.  Crispness is OK.  Even mouth feel is good, but there is a lingering (not good) taste - again, kind of like Pringles.  PS: the flavors are OK but definitely taste like they were made at that flavor factory along the Jersey Turnpike. Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of \"Wow!\" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); thats about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, its no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.The only place you might gain is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettles nutrition info... just about a wash.And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You wont have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.But... bottom line... expensive junk \"health food\". \"Wow!\". OK...but would never buy them again my husband ate some... I thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call MUNCHOS! Just not for me! Ive heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips. I couldnt eat them though, they just dont taste good to me personally. My grandmother loved them though and I gave the rest to her. I decided to give these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they were...Bad idea!  I almost ordered two since they were such a good price, I am so glad I didnt!  We dont care of these AT ALL!  The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny!  They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable.  We have been slowly (and I mean very slowly) making our way through the 24 the box brought (we still have 19 left and we received them over two weeks ago) so they are not so horrible that you cant eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we dont have to throw them all away!  If you havent had them before, I suggest trying them before committing to 24 bags of various yucky flavors! I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didnt enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on. I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, Ive been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.I ordered these thinking thatd theyd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... Ive tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-tos at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they arent as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.Im trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but theres really not much more I can say.****SUMMARY****How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (its sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)Would I suggest buying them? No. If youre eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so theyre definitely expanding.Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:**POP CHIPS:**Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g**BAKED LAYS:**Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus theres more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but Id strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO\">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lays Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> ) the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor.  all the other flavor was just so-so These chips are too salty!!!I like the crunch, size of the bags, and variety.But i cannot finish the case due to how salty these chips are. The only flavor we could stand was the barbecue (which was the reason we purchased them in the first place)!  I had to give the others away!!!  I wont be buying this again for lunches although the size/packaging was great.  I just wish the other flavors tasted better (plain, salt, pepper, etc., werent really kid-friendly). These chips taste so dry and gross, I would rather eat carrots or something than these. They just didnt satisfy the salty craving and werent worth the calories. I bought this because I had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places. I thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro. However, this is very poorly designed. I could not open it whats-or-ever, even after searching through reviews after reviews. Finally, my genius boyfriend found the solution! Basically, you will need to open it from the BOTTOM. You will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it. You will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while theres water in the pot. If any one who is reading this still having problem opening it. Let me know. Ill try to explain it better there. But anyway, this is a pretty useless product for its productivity, but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own, and wants a prettier fridge. You can make you own with a cup (or any container) filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb....(so unless you have money to waste, dont buy this useless pot). I have had the herb pods for about 6 months.  They are a great concept, but have a poor design. The plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on.  Im  constantly afraid that Im going to break it.  The pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water.  Unfortunately I dont use them half of the time I buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth. With no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit, the first few times are an act of frustration.  When I finally realized that if I grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield, about one third from its bottom and squeeze the sides, the bottom lip pops out nicely.I will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley, basil ect.  The company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly.All in all I like it, I took away one star for the lack of instructions.3/2012: After a few months I have thrown this thing away.  It became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs I use most.  I have seen some newer, larger units that dont have the issue with opening it like this one has...Im going to order one of these.I no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to 2 stars. The reviews on this are so true. Great idea, but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side, even once I figured it out. I keep waiting for it to break in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid - but it feels fragile and likely to break with too much pressure. I would consider buying one of the new designs that seem sturdier and open from the top (not the side). Even with the tips shared on how to open it, its still pretty difficult to open.  I guess I have weak hands. My husband usually has to open it for me, and even he doesnt do it with ease.  I would recommend getting the larger Prepara herb savor instead of the pod.  Its much easier to open and can hold more.  I could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod (considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and I only use half). Saw this on Oprahs favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldnt open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than lightly, I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments Ive read, were not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs! Ive gone back to my old method...a wide-mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric...it works! I wanted very much to like this product, but after using it for more than 9 months, I just cant. The clear plastic cover is very difficult to get off, especially when the pod is filled with water. Its also difficult to get the cover on, especially when youre trying to store bushy herbs like parsley or cilantro. The o-ring that is supposed to seal the bottom of the pod doesnt seem to seat correctly. After removing the bottom of the pod to clean out dirt left behind from some rooted herbs, Ive never again been able to get it to be water-tight. Consequently, every time I use my pod,I have to store it in a bowl or else Im mopping up water from my fridge shelf. On the plus side, the leaky bottom helps to remind me to change the water every day! The Prepara Herb Savor Pod is advertised holding asparagus. That was why I purchased it, thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. In reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short.  The ad is misleading. Ill keep it for storing herbs, but asparagus is out of the question. EDIT:  I just noticed each bag is only 1.76 pounds, not 2.2.  My review is not 2 stars instead of three.First off, as you can probably guess by the pictures, these are sour gummies.  That isnt said in the description.  Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide.Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldnt make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.  After all, they will eat anything sugar coated right? I purchased this item because it was cheaper than other olive juices. i was looking for a good quality olive juice for martinis. i was pretty disappointed. the juice is very strong. i followed the instructions and put the ratio on the bottle into the shaker and made a martini. the ratio was 2 part vodka to 1 part olive juice. it was way too salty. the olive juice was over powering. i made a decent dirty martini with 2 parts vodka 1/4 part olive juice. i would not recommend this item. This product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important!  I prefer to drink my Grey Goose straight; however, on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice.  This product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice.  Its not worth it!!  The after taste is worse!! Sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill. This is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti-caking agent into your food, and no iodide. The anti-caking agent isnt event that effective, so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit. Stay away! This candy tasted like sugar without much rose flavor at all.I ended up throwing most of it out because I dont like so much sugar.... I prefer strong flavors like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KYOENE\">Altoids Twin Pack Mints, Wintergreen 2 tins</a>The center of the candy does have a licorice flavor because its an anise seed.  But there are better licorice candies out there like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JTZLK\">Twizzlers Twists, Black  Licorice, 1-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a>. I too was a little disappointed with the mix of the Donut Sampler. In my case I had 12 of the 35 were decaf.  But I guess this is what you get when you purchase a sampler pack through the Amazon warehouse deals section.  All the k-cups had a best used by date of 6/2012.  I was happy about that atleast. I got this on the warehouse deal so I wasnt expecting much. However, be advised you will get NO regular Donut Shop and instead you will receive over half of the box as decaf. I love the flavors of all of these though, so thats ok. But I will think hard about getting another variety pack. Didnt really enjoy these after wanting to try something other than aunt jemimas from Dominicks. The pancakes tasted strange and sometimes forgettable, but it might have been due to the poor packaging they came in along with the syrup. This mix produced some pretty bland pancakes.  Followed the directions on the canister and the batter was pretty thin which in turn produced some pretty thin pancakes.  Considering the ingredients that needed to be added, it would have been just as easy to create my own buttermilk pancakes from scratch.  I debating trying to figure out how to jazz up the remaining canisters I have left (maybe some pumpkin pie spice) but that wont help the thicken up the batter. Makes OKAY pancakes. Only marginally better than the standard Bisquick recipe. They are edible (I should say that my kids liked them).Not that great, in my opinion. We didnt care for this product at all. It seemed to have a funny after taste to it. Wasnt worth the cost. We were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty. What am I missing?This mix creates a pretty much tasteless pancake. Ive tried adding vanilla and cinnamon. I use real maple syrup on top. I cook them in fresh bacon grease. The pancakes are still, just, blah. Its like they absorb and negate the flavors.The pancakes cook ok. The texture is fine. Just absolutely no flavor.Wont get this again. Considering pitching the rest of what I have. I was hoping for the gift box, instead I got a cardboard box full of a mixed bag of K cups.  Dont get me wrong, if the price is right then I have no problem, but the price was a little misleading.  I was under the impression that this would be in a sampler box, not a warehouse box.  It looks like a mix and match of K Cups that fell out of other packages or were returned. Buyer beware. I bought this because its organic cheese puff. My son love Gerber cheese Lil Crunchies. I thought he may like this too. I subscribe it once a month. Now there is 4 cans not open. The idea of mixing cheese and carrot is great, but there is no taste for this cheese snack. There is no cheese flavor in the puff. My son opened the can and keeps giving the puff to me. My son love Happybabys yogurt melts, beef stew, happy baby banana beet blueberry and Spinach, Mango and Pear. This cheese puff does not work for him. I ordered through source in the past and cancelled my membership due to the excessive charges every month. I was happy to look on amazon and find that I could purchase for much cheaper and use my prime account. This tea IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT CAME IN THE BLACK BOX..The orignal tea is brown and this tea is green...the pamphlet is the same inside as the other and the fragile tea bags are the same but the tea is different. This one comes packaged much preetier but it does not taste the same. I have lost 20 pounds in the last 2 months by drinking this tea in the morning and only water throughout the day that is my only diet change. I used the other tea for a month and half and this new tea for 3 weeks now.. I dont want to stop taking the tea just is in case it is the contributor to my weight loss. The next order I will try the other tea that you have to pay for shipping on. I hope I can find this orginal stuff because this is not it. Just got my teabags today, and the first bag I made tea with... the part of the teabag where the string is connected to the bag tore across the bag after seeping.  The bag remained intact though. The second bag, while unwrapping the teabag... the tag ripped the bag right open.The tea tasted fine, not very strong like most other oolong teas.  The quality of the tea bag is like some flimsy material.  Two out of two broke... I guess I need to be more careful with the others. Holy cow!  I have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this!  Also, it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs!  Use it in your garden, dont eat it! Very bitter and not nearly as thick as expected. Very runny, actually. There are better brands out there. Hi,My first grandson was born and I wanted everything under the sun to celebrate!  This is a wonderful idea that has been around for a very long time!  HOWEVER......everything was fine and wonderful except the fact that they just werent fresh.  These little bubble gum cigars were as hard as a rock!  The moral of the story is that being a \"fun\" item the shipping was as much as the cigars themselves....at least they could have been fresh and not hard. You order (and pay for)D.O.P. Certified San Marzano tomatoes but you will receive \"CERTIFIED\" which means absolutely nothing. A true SM tomato will have an EU D.O.P emblem on the label plus the Corsorzio San Marzano stamp. This is false advertising.  If you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps. You will not receive this DOP label.  You will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the Cento name. Typical marketing hoodwinking. Amazon refuses to take returns on this item, so beware. I purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago, and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener wont open them.  I complained to Amazon and they shipped another case out right away - but those cans are worse than the first case!  I wont order again. If your newborn cries inconsolably, you should try a lactose-free formula right away even though theyre so expensive. However, the ingredients may not look so good.  Its important to shop around if youre going to use a lactose-free formula. Lactose-free formulas always are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solids.From Wikipedia: \"Baby colic (also known as infant colic, three-month colic, infantile colic and colic) is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason.\" Youll know it if it happens to your baby, and its awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby.  It contains DHA, ARA and iron, but all baby formulas do because it is required by law.Lactose-free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process, Im told by the companys public relations representative.  So much food in the U.S. is prepared with corn syrup solids, so that shouldnt be a worry, Im told.  Ok, but I notice the obesity rate is high. I bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenser:(1) Its made of cheap plastic and arrived w/ the globe scratched and cracked.(2) The top doesnt screw on--it just pops off w/ very little exertion.(3) Part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin-operated.  What the description on Amazon doesnt tell you, however, is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy.  Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.(4) The dispenser only came w/ enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.(5) It is very much over-priced at $29.99. I found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing. If I cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt, it was OK. Would not order this flavor again. Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest. The treats were ok,my main complaint is they were small about the size of a lifesaver.Which made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treat.One treat just di not do it.This package should be labeled for toy or small dogs. Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest. I bought 2 bottles of this Tart Cherry Juice because they were cheaper than TART IS SMART. They may be providing the Anti Oxidents that they say but they completely failed me in helping to sleep better at night. I returned 1 bottle to Amazon & went back to TART IS SMART. I used to wake up 3-4 times a night & have trouble getting back to sleep. Being nearly 80 & retired, I can sleep in if I choose. With my TIS formula, I get to sleep fairly quick, wake up 7 hours later & get anothert hour or two after visiting the bathroom. This product may work much better for you but I found one that works for me & will stick with it forever. I hope to read YOUR opinion of this product soon? Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest. I ordered this item in a large quanity, but wanted the items packaged as shown.  They were for favors in a holiday bag for the company employees.  When they arrived a few were packaged as shown but the bulk were loose.  If I had know they would come like this I would have gone to COSTO or some other discount store for the purchase.  The cute little box that would have helped make them special and what I thought I paid for was missing. When tea is decaffeinated, is all the flavor removed? Or is this just lousy tea? In any case, all you get from a couple of these tea bags in a (12 oz.) mug of hot water is--hot water! True, the hot water is slightly brownish after five minutes of steeping, but theres no tea flavor at all. Very disappointing. Carabou Mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee I have ever had, and Ive been drinking coffee for over 4 decades. It tastes just like a piece of burnt toast. The only way I can make it palatable is to put it over ice, add lots of vanilla sugar syrup and milk. Ive got to find some way to justify the purchase and icing it seems to help. Ugh....I tried this as a replacement for the Coconut Water with Pineapple that was available before in the automatic ship program.  This stuff is awful.  Its got added sugar, which is not needed at all and actually makes the drink taste pretty gross.  Never getting this stuff again.  (And I do love coconut water, in general, as it is a fantastic hydrator and tastier than Gatorade...well, usually.  Not this stuff.) Almost gagged at first taste. I have used other coconut based products (water, milk, cooking oil, etc) and this is the first time I have been disappointed. My teenage kids hated it. My son is health food nut and drinks all the protein shakes and he couldnt stand it. I am sure Done is not the healthiest, but one you try that, there is no comparison in flavor tolerance. I love coconut and pineapple, but I was not wild about the ONE Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple. It wasnt BAD ... it had a mildly coconutty (though not sweet) flavor, but it just wasnt anything special. It was rather bland, and I had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up. Since Im not a competitive athlete and dont have any great need to replenish my electrolytes, Id rather just drink water. Im usually into Pineapple and coconut drinks, but this drink just didnt taste all that great to me. The taste doesnt resemble anything close to a Pina Colada flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it.  It just tastes tangy and a little sour... like water that has a bit of sugar and sour-ness to it. Yeah, not really a taste I crave. Im not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink, but it just didnt appeal to me. I really wanted to like it though, because as I said before... I usually love pineapple coconut drinks. This product is billed as an all natural anti-oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage.  Sort of like all-natural Gatorade with anti-oxidents.Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didnt think it was that bad but the drink really didnt appeal to me.In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think Ill stick with plain old gatorade; its cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars. I received a single 8.5 once container of ONE Coconut water with a splash of Pineapple as part of the Amazon Vine program for review.It would have been nice if it had come with a straw, especially considering the price of the product. Now as to the \"Splash of Pineapple\", well it must not have been a very big splash, because I never did taste any pineapple. So what did I taste? It is hard to describe. It doesnt taste like coconut or cane sugar or any \"Natural Fruit flavor\".To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. Its not a bad flavor or a good flavor, its just Meh! flavor. I dont care how \"healthy\" this drink is supposed to be, for its price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.And as a \"thirst quencher\", it doesnt equal up to Gatorade or even a Lemonade. I feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst. Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (\"good source of electrolytes\")?I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  \"It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,\" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  Its mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  Whats the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 \"recycle\" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.Bottom line?  Its not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really dont fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability. this paste is actually what first got me into thai curry, at the time i loved it, made it all the time, then i discovered a better brand of curry paste, hand brand curry paste, premium stuff, amazon doesnt sell :(, hint to amazon, stock it, but you can get it at [...], its based in seattle and they import everything from thailand, the flavor of hands brand is so much better the mae ploy, a huge difference, i went back to mae ploy after having hand brand and i didnt even finish my meal, very bland, boring by comparison, also as a side note, these are very small containers, i was used to buy the large ones at my local asian store, these are like 1/4 the size of those ones. not a good deal if you can find it locally. The taste is good, but I found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable. This made me not want to finish my bowl of soup. It is ok soup, but I expected more, as I love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places. This one is very watery and I could not find any lobster there. I guess it is ok for the price, but I would NEVER buy this brand of the lobster bisque again. As far as canned soups go this is ok. I was disappointed with the texture, extra unexpected bits (shell pieces) and overall quality. Having been spoiled by living in Maine for 20 years before relocating to the south, I tried different brands of canned bisque. I have come to the realization that Lobster Bisque is best when made fresh. I wasnt thrilled because I had to pick out tiny bits of gravel. The flax seeds themselves were fine, top quality. If it werent for the gravel bits (that get through the sieve w/the seeds, I guess?), this would get 5 stars. Given the recent issues with products made in China I have decided to not buy any food products from there so I wont be buying anymore of this snack.  If they ever switch to made in the U.S. Ill buy it again as I did like it. I expected the flavor to be more like that of \"brewed\" green tea. It really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water. Although Im sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants, I wouldnt order this again. As others have said, this is REALLY MILD in flavor!  The instructions call for 1 packet per 16 oz. of water.  There are 6 packets per box.I decided to give it a try as I am basically lazy and wanted some (unsweetened; unlemoned) iced tea that I could make on a moments whim.I started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water; then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got SOME flavor.  Now Im using 3 packets per 16 oz. of water.  (I placed a fairly large order so I could experiment with it AND have it throughout the fall and winter.)Since Im using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor, I will probably not order this item again. What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.unfortunately by doing that to this flavor, the ginger was out of control, and not in a good ginger tea sort of way.Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.

I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. Its too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while Ill try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. Its not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people. What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets.

I bought this \"flavor\" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, its useless.If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so youre much better off brewing your own.However, if youre idea is to \"stash\" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) its still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so youd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure its worth it at all, Id rather drink lemon water when out than this.

This was a big disappointment. There was no raspberry or pomegranate flavor to this. The color is green and not very appealing to look at. However it does work as a great antioxidant. Upon opening the sealed bag, I was struck by an unpleasant scent.  Looking at the ingredients I saw, in addition to the black tea and rosebuds, a \"natural flavor\" additive.  I believe this additive is the culprit to ruining what should have been a delightful bouquet to my nose.  Then I brewed this tea, and could still taste that additive, but overall the tea was tasty.  I hope the Davidson family reads our reviews because I am certain that, if they would just refrain from adding the \"natural flavor,\" I and others would find this tea to be superb, and in keeping with the other teas I have come to enjoy from Davidsons.  For example, upon opening their Darjeeling loose tea, as well as their Assam loose tea, my nose is struck with a lovely bouquet ~ this is what one wants to experience from superb teas.  I will look forward to Davidsons responding to my (and other customers) suggestion re: this nasty flavor additive.  Ive enjoyed tea with rose petals while in India, and they did not put anything other than the tea and the dried rose petals. When I ordered this tea, I was so excited because I thought I had finally found the equal to another brands rose tea (in individual bags). I was excited for the loose quality of the tea, along with the anticipated light delicate taste Id hoped for.I was sadly mistaken... When I excitedly opened it, I was hit by a very sweet, syrupy, cotton-candy-like smell coming from the bag. Not a good scent. Then, I thought the smell doesnt determine the taste so I steeped the recommended tablespoons for the amount of time indicated and then tried a taste. The overpowering sweet smell gave was to a bitter taste, not at all reminiscent of my previous experience with rose tea. Unfortunately, I had to pour the rest of mine out.I have a bag of Hibiscus tea coming in the mail soon from this company. Im really hoping its better! I purchased the baby white by accident.  We usually get the medium white, which is great.  The baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it. Tasty, small kernel popcorn. However, too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper. The kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped. Popcorn has grear color (white)  But taste is average and due to shipping costing more then product, I would not buy again. Bought 6lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this Baby White than on regular popcorn.  Not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn, the corn pops up so tiny that its about 1/3 hull, 2/3 popped corn per kernel! I was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls.I popped this using every tip I could find on the internet; all experiments still resulted in a tough hull. the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped, very small kernels and scorched the bottom of my new whirley popper. Ive had several poppers and this is the first time one has scorched and the first time Ive used the Wabash corn. shipping charges were very high for a relatively inexpensive corn. wE LOVED THIS POPCORN  BUT COME ON  SHIPPING IS WAY OVER THE TOP  WE WOULD SETTLE NEXT TIME FOR SOMETHING WE CAN BUY BUT NOT SPEND 3 TIMES ON SHIPPING Ive just prepared my first can of this soup.  It tasted incredibly bland, and didnt have much clam flavor.  So then I added more milk, butter, onions, salt and fresh ground pepper, plus white wine.  For 2.92 per 15 oz. can, all of those ingredients should have been adequately added in there already, except for the pepper. Bar Harbor brand certainly didnt stint on the other ingredients in order to increase the amount of clams, thats for sure.  There were larger pieces of clams than in Progressos - but thats damning with faint praise.  Next time Ill buy the clams and make my own, for less, probably.  Im just perplexed by these reviews;  I think I can safely say Progressos tastes better.  And, of course, its much less expensive. Im a little perplexed by all the great reviews.  This was the most bland chowder Ive ever had.  I prepared it with just milk and a little butter, and it tasted like nothing!  Added some salt and white pepper, still nothing.  Added some black pepper and Provence herbs, now it tastes like herbed potato soup.On the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender.  The consistency was pretty good too.  It just had no flavor.  Not going to be buying this again, certainly not when its this expensive, too. My local store had the product lineon close-out at 77 cents a can so I bought a dozen cans of different verities. Lobster soup was very fishy for starters and the Manhattan chowder was very watered down.  The New England chowder is somehow creamy and void of flavor.  The Clam corn chowder was not enjoyable.  I am real soup eater and take soup at least once a day and always when I dine out.  Long story short... This is the most tasteless soup and just not good.  I suggest you pass on this and I am sure Cambells will be a much better choice than these soups... Sorry, I had leave an unfavorable review bit this soup is just not worth eating and 77 cents a can I would never buy this again I expected better from a premium Maine chowder. This is no better than, say, Snows, which you can get for less than half the price. Not bad, but not worth the money. When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they dont seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they dont consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a \"gravy\" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters. This product doesnt have the greatest taste. I like Jamba coconut water, but its hard product to find. I purchased this to try out and Im not liking it, but its tolerable when its cold; really cold (reason why I gave it two stars).  I tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough, they were right. I had hoped that this would taste like Pina Coladas but it doesnt.  It is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue.  I wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is good in mixed drinks.  I have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol.  If you are going to drink this straight, it helps if it is really cold....almost frozen.  If you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing I can taste in it, The product description says 12 packs of 12 (144 count), but when you order, you only get a box of twelve.  I did this weeks ago, talked to Amazon, but they still havent updated the product description. I was sorely disappointed in these cookies.. They are pretty tasteless and damn hard too.. I wouldnt buy them again and Ive certainly tasted much better low-cal cookies.. I definitely recommend saving your money, folks.. Chips Ahoy cookies were not very tasty.  My children and husband would not eat them.  I tried to give them away and everyone refused. Well, when I bought this item....I thought it would be a direct Japan import.  It is Taiwanese.It was bought at Costco and resold....(the price label was still the product.)The product can be bought at Costco for half the price...if not less.The expiration date was not printed on the product....which makes me think it was expired.I believe this as most of the mochi is dry and tough..Will shy away from this product. Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isnt, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all. Sent this as a gift, and found out later that many items were stale.  They loved the thought, though, and loved the way it looked. The shipping was very fast, but so was the expiration date.... got it on Feb. 14, 2012 expiration is April 4, 2012 (only 6 weeks before it expires).  Who can eat so much seaweed in such a short time??????  I should have returned it, but who wants to go through all the trouble.  Well I stuffed it all in the freezer and hope it will be still eatable.  Thats what you get when you order food online.  I will not order it again!!!! I made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix.  They were just ok.  They were dense, but not overly so.  So that wasnt too bad. The flavor, however, is where I was disappointed.  The vanilla flavor was so subtle that I missed it entirely, and I felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness (which probably would have also made them a bit more moist). The child I made them for only ate a few bites. I was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong!  i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all! So disappointed! I now have to go out n find the normal size cookies. What a  waste of money. I also needed 50 but 20 of them were broken. They do not put fragile on the box outside. If you want the best wild rice, buy the regular kind. This \"quick cook\" type is not near the taste quality of the regular/ 40 minute cook time rice., I love these cookies, they taste exactly like Oreos. But unfortunately, every time I eat them (2 cookies at a time)I get horrible headaches and migraines (which I dont get from real Oreos) Its obviously caused by some of the nutritious ingredients. Another thumbs down---they include vitamin K which should not be eaten by anyone on blood thinners, or for anyone middle-aged or older who overindulges in these cookies be warned---vitamin K can cause blood clots.HEADACHE & MIGRAINE SUFFERERS BEWARE of these cookies! im a big fan of hodgson mill products (we love their bread mixes, i use their pancake mixes.) im not afraid of whole grains  (i mill my own grains, wheat, kamut, rye, barley) and i even put milled flax seed in my (home made) yogurt. Ive been a baker for 35 years and love to try new recipes.i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results: the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth.  I can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the boxone of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well.i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch.  a little bit of time required... a little less convenient but brownies being a treat (and comfort food), the texture should be right :) A short while ago, my doctor looked me in the eye and said, \"Buddy, you got acid reflux real bad.\"  (My dentist said the same - only he was able to make his announcement a bit more colorful by showing `worst case scenario pictures of teeth on battery acid. He put me off coffee for a week.)  So, with that double-whammy in mind, Ive lately been trying to cut back on acidic foods.  Hence my decision to go the low-acid coffee route.And like the headline says, this coffee is a good news bad news situation.First, the good news: Puroast Coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately low-acid.  Ive noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it.Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad.  I should note, this isnt the opinion of a coffee snob:  while I like a good cup of Peets Coffee as much as the next guy, Im a-okay with a batch of Folgers or the basic house brand of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in.  Im usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isnt highway robbery.Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee aint that pleasant kick start.  Theres an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe - other than to say that Puroast doesnt really taste like French Roast coffee.  Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains.So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.  But if youre looking for a pleasant, low acid kick start to your day, black tea might be a better, tastier option. This coffee smells really bad - there is definitely no \"delicious\" smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug.  It tastes just as awful too.  The first couple sips that I had, with my nose closed so I couldnt smell it, wasnt too bad but the more sips I took the more disgusting it was.  It is absolutely stomach turning (to me at least) and unfortunately I will never drink the whole bag. It tastes like a weak, poorly brewed, cheap cup of coffee (though not cheap!).  The only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder - just irritated my nose and taste buds. White bread is not my thing, so thats probably why I dont like this one.  I like herby white breads and really full-bodied white breads, but otherwise I always choose whole grains.  This one is not full-bodied and has no particular flavor.  Not interesting at all to me. I have a recurring shipment of this product each month.  Every month when the boxes arrive they are barely in one piece and VERY mangled.  Last month one of the cases of water had to be repackaged before it arrived and it was a day late.I suggest using a more sturdy box for shipping.The water product is fine ... its just the shipping packaging I have a problem with. Somehow my previous review got deleted. I live in Houston, TX. I buy lots of bottled water-cannot tell any difference between a bottle of Talking Rain and a glass of cold tap water. I found this too sweet. Am hoping theres an unsweetened version available. Not very chocolatey too, kinda like Swiss miss. I have to admit based on most of the reviews I was sold on getting the 48 pack.  Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.  That is the name of the artificial sweetner, in the product.  If you like Splenda,you may like this.  But, it has a distinct taste. Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,\"It wasnt bad.\" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar. If your going to order I would get the small pack to try it.  Better then throwing out 30.  Try Cafe Escapes and Swiss Miss and see for yourself. very easy to use not the best flavor It has too much sugar and is not a quality I thought I was getting A hot chocolate packet was the first K-Cup on my new Keurig (it was 1 a.m. and I wasnt ready for coffee before bed). I had read they ran a little watery but I decided to try it on the 10 oz. setting, took a sip, and tossed it. The next morning I made one with 8 oz. and added some whipped cream. The taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery. My husband made one to try at 6 oz. and said it tasted like sugar water. I might try combining 2-3 6 oz. servings to use the box up but we wont be buying more. I really, really dislike Sucralose.  I dont like the taste, the aftertaste, or the after effects.  I bought this based on it NOT saying it was \"diet\" or \"low calorie\".  The first ingredient is Sugar so its only partially sweetened with Sucralose.  Sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable.Sure wish Amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products. This tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesnt taste very chocolatey. The name brand cocoa Kkups are better, or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better. Thin, runny, and the fake milk powder used to add \"creaminess\" has an off flavor. Better off eating your ceramic mug. I wish I had listened to the other bad reviews.  The artificial sweetener taste is awful.  I gave two stars only because my husband doesnt seem to mind.  I cant drink this- even if they were a bargain. I bought this for my daughter and grandson. They both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it. Therefore I will not buy it again. The artificial sweetener ruined this for me... It leaves the fake sugar taste in your mouth and my husband, who drinks diet soda, even noticed. At least it wasnt pricey. I just got a Keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee.  I didnt have super high expectations, but these are absolutely awful.  There is a very strong plastic/chemical taste to these k-cups.  I tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help.  The only reason I gave these k-cups 2 stars is because my boyfriend can \"tolerate\" them, but I dont trust him because hell eat just about anything.  In his opinion they are \"not that good\" but he will still drink the mug.From what Ive read of other hot chocolate k-cups, youd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way! Well you get what you paid for. While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho, in fact kinda too sweet for my taste (i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar/sweetener). I thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so I lowered the cup size from 8 ounce to 6 ounce on my Keurig brewer and its the same thing. This is much too watery. It tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine.  After receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients,  Ive decided not to order again.  This product if definitely not worth the money. With <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00389Q4XW\">Green Mountain Hot Cocoa</a> being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought Id give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first \"unofficial\" producers of \"we cant legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker\" pods, and I thought that Id be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think thats the nicest I can be.As others have pointed out, theres a definite \"diet\" or \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK\">Splenda</a>\" aftertaste. This hadnt been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didnt see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.\"Well... its got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want.\" and the ingredient list didnt seem to point to obvious \"diet\" sweeteners.The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didnt seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now Ive got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I cant sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, youre probably going to like this. Had I known this cocoa was sugar-free, I would not have purchased it. I realize that this will not bother some people, but I really dont like the aftertaste of fake sugar.  In the interest of fairness, this did not seem to trouble my nephew!  Just update the description. My whole family(7 people) tasted all 3 flavors and they are sickly sweet.  Very disappointed that product has sucralose.  I wouldnt buy it again Using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak. It was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup. Using 6 oz made the cocoa much too sweet, and still too weak in the chocolate department. It uses sucralose as a sweetener, which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor. This may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or dont mind the taste of sucralose. Unfortunately, Im not one of those people. I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct \"plasticy\" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just cant fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesnt taste watered down. Im going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way. This hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products.  We tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone well be going back to the cafe escapes brand. The Cocoa wasnt too bad. The taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes.  I was disappointed though when I went to a local store and saw it for less than what I paid just for shipping.  I really thought I was getting a good deal until I went home and checked the ticket.  I just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house! SO DISAPPPOINTED!!:( Found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too.  They complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod.  Kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging, so we switched back to packets. Thought Id try these because its a good price, but the chocolate flavor is not that good. And the sucralose taste is very strong. I like the Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate ones better, even though those have sucralose too, you cant really taste it. We bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then Cafe Escapes dark chocolate.  It was also thinner in consistency. Wont buy again We bought this to replace our Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa.  They are less expensive- but you get what you pay for.  This cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste.  I do not recommend it.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q1T0\">Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups, Dark,Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> Im an avid hot chocolate drinker, and this is just doesnt measure up.  It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.  No matter what size you set your cup on, its just missing that cocoa flavor.  Maybe the dark chocolate would be better.  I personally like the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate better!I bought a 24 pack, and then I was able to find it at my local grocery store, so I bought another one.  Now, Im stuck with the 24 pack. there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, Ive even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didnt, so im just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig. This hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. Although, even the sugary taste is weak, and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. The consistency is watery and bland. This is when I made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box.I do not recommend this product. I thought the Grove hot chocolate is to sweet. It also has an off taste. I would not recommend this to anybody Becareful if you plan to use these more then two months after you order them, they expire quick. I cant use these, I ordered them to use in my November wedding but they expire in March :( What more can I say. Barley Edible - Crunch on Sugar.  Did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it didnt sell or maybe bad batch.  Doesnt make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth.  Kids probably dont care.  Hope this helps. I wait for this cereal to go on sale before I buy it and the sale price is usually $1.99 per 12 ounce box.  The regular price is about $4.$28.88 for 70 small boxes of less than one ounce each is 41 cents per box/nearly per ounce. The sale price is 17 cents per ounce.  The regular price is 33 cents per ounce.On the other hand, this should make two rice krispie treats with one box.  Starbucks sells rice krispie treats for $2 as one of their lowest priced snacks. I bought this for fathers day. My father loves dried fruits and nuts.It came in a somewhat cute crate box, and each compartment was in a plastic bag. That means that if you dont eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale, as they are now sitting in the open. Same story for the fruit.While all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard/chewy.I recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece, but not if you actually want to eat it. I have to say that I really wanted to like these muffins, but I could not.  They have a really bitter after taste.  Whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product, I do not know.  The Hodgson Mill Blueberry Muffin Mix is a far better choice.  On a positive note, they do raise very nicely, but it is unfortunate that I find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left. These came out smaller than I expected, but the taste as not as good as I thought it should be.  Second time, I added a couple of items, which helped a little, but it is hard to find a great tasting boxed muffin mix.  I thought it would save me time, but I like my own muffins better.  My husband thought they were okay, but not great. I bought these at my local grocery store. I wish I would have read the review on here first. The positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin. The negative is they are so bitter. I could barely finish my half. I just recently found out I have Celiac Disease  so I cant have gluten. I have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so I can not compare it to any others. I have tried the Betty Crocker Gluten Free brownie mix and that is wonderful. So I do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there. I concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste! I also bake often and Im certain it wasnt me. My gluten-eating husband didnt like them either. They were also dense.If you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix, you might be better off using Pamelas Baking Mix (which is awesome!) and adding apples and cinnamon to it. The muffin recipe is on the back of the Pamela bag.In conclusion, I dont recommend these; they were really disappointing. I really didnt notice Elmo on the package? These are for kids more than adults. Nothing wrong with flavor, but priced for kids that scream alot. These have an artificial sweetener aftertaste. Not pleasant. I would not purchase them again. This the first Kcup hot chocolate Ive tried, Ill keep looking. These were a little disappointing. The hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange...kind of plastic tasting. Havent been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig Sure to be a hit with chalk-a-holics everywhere, from first sip to last this product suggests its European heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern France.Some seem to be making a case for it only having 60 calories, but the Keurig Chai Latte only has 70, and that product actually tastes pretty good.I have yet to find a Keurig-compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old Swiss Miss, scooped from a tub or a foil packet. And Swiss Miss isnt that great to begin with, although it sure is cheaper than this stuff.I wonder if the size of the Keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup, so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised. My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay. The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk. Not absolutely terrible but worse than average. Try Pamelas chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful, or try a baking mix. Although this coffee tastes fine there is nowhere enough coffee in the pod.  The cup that is brewed even with a smaller amount of water is weak and watery. To make a decent cup of coffee I have to use two pods at a time. I prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it IS decaf.What happened to Senseo decaf? I have a Melitta One:One machine and have been using Juan Valdez pods in it.  When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta-brand ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others werent available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee. Its not real crispy, sticks to your teeth and lots of hulls.I know homemade popcorn has a few more kernel hulls than your store-bought microwave, but its a little too much for me. I was really hopeful for this brand. But, it just didnt work out. I tried a couple of different methods; popped using different temperatures, and also tried different oils. It was the same both times with no improvement. It doesnt get better after it cools either..nothing worked to improve it.It doesnt taste old, so I know its not that. I seal my popcorn kernels when Im not using them as well. The flavor is really mild and its definitely a good tasting popcorn. It just doesnt turn out the way it should. the product was advertizes as hot sausage;s. the lable on jar say;s [ hot sausage ]. but they not even warm . the sausage;s do have agood flavor but just pickled. we have been serving these type of products at our vfw for years so i know what im talking about. I ordered this prouct along with 2 others. I bought all together to get the \"FREE SHIPPING over $30\". What really happened is that each item shipped from a different location and I was charged seperate shipping for each. The shipping was such that I could buy these products more cheaply at the corner drug store. I feel I was misled into overbuying and was left feeling ripped off by Amazon. This is the experience I shared with my friends. After this purchase I bought books from Walmart on line for the first time. I love the product.  But, the bottle design is terrible.  In order to get the last 1/3 or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down.  With the pointy top that is impossible.  So, you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out.  This takes much more time that youll want it to take.  Redesign the bottle with a flat top...please. SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOURE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,Whats in Kelloggs Corn Flakes? \"Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt.\" Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or youll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner packages failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum-sealed container like Kretschmers Wheat Germ to preserve freshness? After all, its in the same price range!So if you are hungry, you are really eating the wrong stuff. SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU ARE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO OTHER HUNGRY PEOPLE PLEASE! These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag-closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original \"Chips Ahoy!\" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes. Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  Ill stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie. I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. Wrong! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just dont work well together. I wish I had read the item listing more carefully. Even my kids said \"Blech!\". I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.*For those that dont know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. Higher end units add some EQ capability as well or have other options. I find that even with the gain on maximum, the volume is not very loud.  I use it with a Shure SM57 mic and my Macbook (using Audacity).  One must be very close to the mike and speak somewhat loudly.  When I use the Shure mics with a mixer (the \"analog\" way), there are no volume problems.It is simple to set up, being almost \"plug and play\".  You have to choose the input source. the product was simply not recognized by my windows 7 home premium computer. very disappointed, considering on the Blue website it says that it is. I gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product, but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing. Most likely wont be buying anything else from Blue Picked one up to use with a laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium.  The computer saw the item, but said it needed troubleshooting.  Nothing worked.  After researching online, I found that many people had run into this problem.  Apparently, the firmware is not compatible with Windows 7; its supposedly been corrected in newer runs, but theres no way to tell if the one youre purchasing is newer or not.  I tried contacting Blue, twice, hoping to get a firmware update, or check into exchanging it, but never got a response from both attempts, so I finally just had to return it. I wanted to like this product, as it would have been a fast and easy solution for many of my needs, but it didnt work well at all.  Very noisy.  Lots of hissing and pops that are completely absent when using the same mics and computers with other adapter devices.  Considering the decent reviews by others, I may just have a defective unit.  Either way... its going back in the mail today. I was hoping Bisquick got it right when they released this product, but they missed their mark.I made both biscuits and dumplings (chicken & Dumplings). The biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland. The dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two. I love pancakes, so giving up gluten was hard for me.  Ive used Bisquick for pancakes for years with great results.  Alas, the best I got from the Gluten-Free version was edible, but not enjoyable.  It tasted a lot like pillow foam, not in a good way.  I will probably keep the mix for breading things, but not for pancakes.  Ive found much better options. Overall, this mix is okay, but, the sugar content is very, very high. You can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely. For pancakes or waffles, this is fine, but for savory concoctions, this is not acceptable. Sausage balls, casseroles, and biscuits all come out almost inedible.This mix is also oddly gritty. The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl.  I recommend Pamelas baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because its not as sweet. A good cook knows you can always add more of something, but you cant take it out if youve added too much.That being said, if youre traveling and this is the only mix they have, its better than nothing. I was so excited to get this and try it.  Unfortunately Im not impressed.For starters the value is terrible.  You get 3 cups of mix per box.  Thats enough to make 1 batch of pancakes and 1 batch of biscuits (or 3 batches of pancakes whatever).  For almost 4.50 a box thats not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best.  For the biscuits I made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them.  The pancakes were okay if I used twice as much real maple syrup as I normally do.The pros?The biscuits did puff up nicely.  Thats the only pro I have. I made pancakes and biscuits with this mix and found them to be mediocre at best.  I really tried to like this product, but the taste is just so far off -- for me.  I wanted a break from making things from scratch, but this just was not worth it. I ran out of Pamelas mix and bought this in a regular grocery store because it was all they had.  I followed the pancake recipe on the back.  As a person with celiac who has tried many things, I knew when I saw the fine, crystalline mix it wasnt going to be good.  The batter is pasty looking.  The pancakes were too dense and slightly off.  The end product was pretty bland.  You will be much better off with Pamelas mix.  Pamelas can be served to a gluten eater; I cannot say the same for this product. The rice flour in it is a crude gritty grade (cheap?). If youve ever used Thai rice flour <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYC096\">Thai Rice Flour - 16 oz</a>, you know that rice flour does not need to be this unpleasantly gritty.I tried compensating for the grit by using Bisquick Gluten Free to make Johnny cakes since the cornmeal is sort of gritty. But sadly, after you chew you are still left with this unpleasant grit like fine sand in your mouth. My personal preference is to stay clear of this. I did not like the smell or taste. I was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time. On my second attempt it came out better, but I did not like the taste of it. If I at least liked the taste, I would buy again and make my crust very thin. I bought these for pancakes, and I havent used it to make any other recipes, so I cannot speak for how it makes biscuits, or any other item. But for pancakes, its a no-go. They have a hint of pancake-flavor with lots of butter & syrup; but I dont like smoothering my pancakes in fattening syrup, so these pancakes are NOT for me. Moving on to other mixes... Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free/dairy free.  Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  Ive found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by \"The cravings place\" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice. It would have been better to have a print/picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great DF option. These pancakes are gross... they are pale and do not taste like pancakes. I bought these based on the reviews because the Maple Grove Farms pancakes were out of stock that week. I expected a lot more from Bisquick. I mean, when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat. If you leave them in a little longer to get some color, they just get hard and taste worse. I hate wasting food so I forced myself to finish the 3 boxes.. but I dont think Ill buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock. The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because they are gluten free. Other than that theyre awful.. Im so glad Ive got my Maple Groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry! Now if you could just make it sugar-free also?  I know, I dont want for much.  :-)<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0\">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> I read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles.  So I whipped up some pancakes, breakfast-for-dinner style.  Im newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to GF, so perhaps I should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before I start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods I used to love, but I swear I cried a little bit when I ate these pancakes.  Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I dont know if thats gluten free but if so its probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so thats something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess Ill never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but thats a whole other thing.Im giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken, but you could do that more economically with another GF flour. The pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores.  It is not available in all stores, but I have found it conveniently enough for my purposes. I am giving this two stars as my family didnt mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily. I was not a fan of the pancakes at all I believe they really didnt have a good flavor. Will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less? Not fair to us with allergies in my opinion!! I ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re: small diameter size.  Absolutely true, and I regret making the purchase. For the same price, I briefly ordered from a different Amazon vendor the same # and length bully sticks for the same price.  Difference?  Original vendor bully sticks were on average 3/4\" thick.  This vendor bully sticks are at MOST 1/2\" thick, with most closer to 1/4\".What difference does it make?Our dog, a slender 44 lb. mixed boxer/chow, would take 3-5 days to get through a 3/4\" bully stick, and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one.  These new thin ones she completely consumes in less than 30 mins.  That makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag!Will not order again from this supplier. I have bought Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it.  In the past, it had 18.25 ounces.  Pillsbury and Betty Crocker have the required ounces 18+.  I bought Duncan Hines at Safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after I got home, I discovered why.  I will not buy Duncan Hines again unless they go back to the 18+ ounces or go to 9 ounces for $.54.  Consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product. I made one for my daughters birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning. Still tasted pretty good, though. While the flavor and quality of this chili is great, the 108-ounce can is mostly liquid. The number of servings is listed as 12, but the reality is that it will only serve about 5, unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated. I wont be purchasing this again. Some reviewers say the coffee is bitter- I like bitter but I didnt like this. It wasnt a good bitter taste, it was a \"cringe\" kind of taste.I drink one of the strongest coffees out there and this was too much for me. The strange taste of it turned me off...I once owned a coffee pot by Melitta too, and it took a cone shaped special filter. I wasnt impressed with that either.Maybe im just not big on Arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me. Not smooth. Bitter yes, but not smooth.It smells ok. I agree with Charlie ( another Amazon Reviewer) who said the package was difficult to open. It was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open, the bag tore apart.No way would I spend 20 bucks for this. If i was addicted to it, possibly, but even then thats steep. And I surely wont buy this in the future.You can go down to the local \"name of popular coffee shop here\" and get 2 bags for this price of FRESHLY ground coffee.Melitta makes it sound like its the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package. Gourmet, Swiss water process, from Europes charming sidewalk cafes, top quality hand- picked beans..If you want to pay this kind of money and like Melitta coffee, then get it, but I dont think its anything special. The initial aroma upon opening the package was decent, though subtle. Unfortunately, it quickly dissipated - I really couldnt smell anything after a minute, which I assume is due to it being pre-ground.I brewed this coffee in a French press as well as in a drip brewer. Both results tasted flat and boring, although there was a decent amount of body - at least it was inoffensive. Perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee. For about the same price, you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store. Ive read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as \"coffee tasting\" or with \"roasted flavors,\" but to be very truthful, it tastes just the way I could imagine second hand smoke would. Its very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. Ive heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this \"roasted\" flavor. First, let me state that I brew most of my tea in a gaiwan, hence, I use loose leaf tea.White tea is one of my favorites so Im always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didnt look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you dont use any filters or screens (like me).  I dont mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you dont pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely wont be ordering it again.That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isnt bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasnt mostly powder.I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins). I purchased this as a present but it doesnt come As shown in the picture.  It is little white bags with the flavor written on them.  Someone receiving it as a gift wouldnt even know what it was unless I explained it to them. Will be returning. I bought this for a Christmas gift, but I will be returning. There is no box or packaging as pictured, it is just 5 white baggies containing the mixes, which would be fine if I was just buying for myself but not for a gift. These english muffins are okay at best.  They are very hard to cut and break apart easily making it hard to toast.  They definitely have to have something like jelly or peanut butter spread on them otherwise, do not taste the best. I tried these for a substitute for a sandwich roll, I couldnt cut them without falling apart!  I ended up toasting them in pieces, more like chunks, and with enough cream cheese, they were only OK!  Tapioca hamburger rolls are the only products I would recommend! Come on Amazon, give me a break.  Powdered tofu?  Get in some real food and Ill buy more from you. I went looking for table sugar. Youve got 100 weird kinds of sugar (that you expect me to buy in bulk!) but NO just plain sugar. Im not eatin any more of this rice and tofu bread either.Sorry I just had to rant. This tea has NO flavor, tastes like dust It \"looks\" like quality -- pretty package -- but its no good. Lipton regular Pekoe is farrr superior. Good but not my favorite.........Newmans Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag....I now buy my dogs Taste of the Wild Salmon just great stuff buy it on Amazon!~ The less fillers the better not meals for my doggies!~ Based on the great reviews from everyone about their picky dogs loving it and always eating it I figured my picky dog would enjoy it as well.  The price for the amount is also very good considering it is all organic but sadly my dog hates it..  She smells it and walks away and when i try to hide the food she finds her way to eat around this food.  I wont be buying it again but I really wished my dog enjoyed it so I could continue to support this brand. I expected Newmans Own dog food to be great.  It may be very nutritious, but my little terriers told me, \"We are NOT eating this stuff.  Period.  No Way.\"  After 3 days they sniffed their bowls and walked away.  So I ordered another organic dog food (Natural Balance Organics) and it came today.  So, half old, half new, by the book, and they picked out the new stuff and left the Newmans in the bowl.  Go figure.  Just thought some of you might like to know.  I am switching them from Iams to something much healthier and I finally think I have a match.  But its not Newmans. If you are looking for an actual organic dog food, Newmans Own is not the way to go. I accidently purchased this thinking it was what it claimed on the front package, only to read the ingredient list to find out that basically everything else but the chicken was organic. With all of the drugs and hormones fed to conventionally raised \"food animals\" this ingredient is the most important one that should be organic. I cringed a little after reading the ingredient list. Way too much grains and not enough quality protein for our dogs. Notice all of them are at the beginning, which means they make up quite a bit of the diet. Soy protein is included but some dogs dont do well with soy (mine) and meat should be the protein source in dog food, not grains.Not recommended for your furry ones. This food is organic, sure.  However, look at the ingredients, top 7 includes chicken meal.  Never feed your pet anything with chicken meal or chicken by product.  Its a cheap substitute, and really is bad for the dog.  I suggest a brand like Evo, Blue Buffalo, ect.  No ingredient should be meal or by product. We have been using Newmans organic dry dog food for over 5 years...it was a Godsend when we discovered it. Our little Jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching...after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief. Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newmans. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jacks itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again. I am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients...but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive...this likely is not for you. Too bad...it once was a superior product. Both of my dogs had trouble with this formula, allergy wise.  It took me a couple of days to realize that their itching was related to the food.  Needless to say I wont buy this product again. When one purchases a product that is called Newmans Organics, one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isnt exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole \"greenwashing\" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good, its like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater, shell pretty much eat anything voraciously, but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isnt getting any more of it. I bought a big pack of this gum.  The flavor (Kiwi Watermelon) is ok, but it didnt last long, I found I would usually pop a new piece in my mouth after about 2-3 minutes to get another shot of flavor.  I Wouldnt really recommend this gum, its not horrible, but not that great either. When I got this it was melted through the package and what wasnt completely destroyed was stuck to the inside of the wrappers.  You would think that if you are going to ship chocolate in the summer time you would pack it in something cold.  I wasnt very happy with it.  I love the candy and once you peeled it off the insides of the wrappers it was good. Very weak blend, slightly bitter aftertaste.  Noticeably light brew when brewing.  Wont purchase again, in fact, I regret this purchase.  Even on 4 oz brew, still really weak taste. After reading all the great reviews, I optimistically ordered some of this tea. Ive had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success.  Unfortunately, this really didnt do anything for me.  The taste is OK (bearable), but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion.  (So far the only things Ive found that have helped me somewhat are the Vicks personal warm mist humidifier and Neti Xlear) I had high hopes when I purchased this produce, shipping was amazingly fast and Ive tried it a few times. I dont enjoy the taste, and since I dont sweeten my tea, it wasnt that great, and it did nothing for my sinuses. Will not purchase again but I do recommend the seller. All natural beef, but too soft for my taste - doesnt have the snap and drier outer surface that some like.  This is a matter of personal taste - the product is good, just not for everyone.I suggest trying this companys old fashioned cold-smoked beef-sticks.  Strong hickory flavor, a good bite of spice, and drier texture.This company has superb customer service! I couldnt resist the price... so many beef sticks for so cheap. However, I think I was expecting something different. The jerky has a good taste, and at first it wasnt very oily, but as they got older (and exposed to the air) I did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks. Overall, if you can consume this, say, within 1 week of opening, they are great! If you need something that will stick around longer (stick, get it?) then maybe this isnt the right product. They also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order, and the shipping was quick. I like the company, the beef sticks just werent what I was looking for, I guess. I took a chance with this product (even though there werent enough good reviews) since they are cheaper than 5 hour energy.  They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper.  Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power. The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it doesnt work. I received these in bad condition. Most of them were broken, but the ones that werent had holes in them. They were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them. I would try three ladies brand. They are a way higher quality. I have one cat who cannot tolerate THIS PARticular Fancy Feast Salmon Product. It is only the Shredded one that gets her, but get it does.Everytime she eats it, she throws it up all over everywhere. My shoes, the white rug and gratefully, the tile.She ate this for several years with occasional upsets, but now it is EVERY time. No more for this family. I realize that this occurs on an individual basis USUALLY.But, I also have one younger kitty who is at the \"occasional upset\" stage. So, if you have a kitty with a tender tummy, I would avoid this!! I really wanted to like these.First off, these cookies are about the size of a half dollar and arent that thick. And they are more like fudge that cookies. Look at the ingredients. They are nut flour held together with honey. They need some egg or something. They are gooey and sticky. They are extremely sweet and pack a whopping 10-15g carbs each and yes that is not counting the fiber.Im sorry I appreciate the effort guys but in my option these are a novetly. They are too expensive and too non-functional to be a serious part of your regular diet. I love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches, salads, etc., but this drink was so vinegary that I got a bit of a tummy ache.  It tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink.  I tried really hard to like it, but no go. These arent as good as other bars of this type. My kids wont eat them, nor will my husband. They are all fond of the Nutrigrain variety, but I thought these would be a healthier alternative. I thought I would try this, but I am sticking with my UNCLE JOES JERK SAUCE!!! This is sweet & not hot....should be hot if they are going to put jerk on the label These are very tasty, but way too sweet & sugary.  I felt like I was eating candy instead of meat.  If thats okay with you, then youll probably love these, but I was looking for something a bit healthier.  Yes, I know it says sweet in the product name, but I bought it because of the no hormone, no antibiotic, no artificial ingredient aspect. I wanted to love this because I LOVE Earl Grey tea, I NEED decaf and I ADORE the convenience of the Keurig.  Unfortunately, I dont love these.  The flavor is very weak and doesnt deliver on the aroma.  I typically use the large cup setting on the 3-size model, but even the small cup is wimpy with these.  I did find that mixing this one with a stronger-flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength, but then you have to make 2 cups of something. The English Breakfast decaf is a much better choice. My kids love these, and weve ordered them often - but as was the case with at least one other reviewer, this batch came in with some mold. (I freeze them as soon as they arrive, so had the have been moldy upon arrival.)too bad - but at this price, wont run the risk of having to toss out product. Ive been feeding Wellness grain-free for a while now and all three of them love it. I ordered the Felidae last time because the Wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the Felidae was - which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at Petco brick and mortar....None of my cats will eat it. They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain-free food on rare occasion, but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter. Hopefully, something there will like it. Im off for the trip to Petco for the Wellness. I was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my 3 cats; looks like it has good ingredients but none of my 3 cats will eat it. In fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop. Another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it, not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing. Yikes!  What was I thinking when I ordered 12 cans of this  stuff?  The food pantry may be getting some.It tastes like.....well, I cant use the words Id like to.Lets just say that it has no character at all...no distinct taste....if yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee, I dont know if youd even know it was coffee!I use just more than the amount suggessted;..;...doesnt help. Warning: it contains food preservatives. Other than that it is fine, but presence of preservatives in dates (!) justifies my low 2 star rating. Spent $29  for real kona coffee and didnt want the kona blend sold here. The Hawaiian roasters was disappointing. Tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while honeymooning in Maui. Not good I like my chocolate tempered to some level of crispness. These nuts were chewy, not crunchy, and the chocolate coating was a bit mealy.If you know anything about dark chocolate, and like yours with some snap, dont order these.Actually, the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called Perigord and are available through a Canadian company called Kis Global.They are sun dried, super crispy, covered in a fairly thin shell of 70% dark chocolate, and dusted with unsweetened cocoa.Very adult and superb. Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says \"Not a significant source of protein.\"  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they dont shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this companys products by, and lets find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way. I agree with a previous reviewer - when it comes to the dinners (just about all of the Earths Best choices) they are watery and SWEET.  Apples (or some other fruit) in just about everything, and the first ingredient is nearly always water.  Ive decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein-containing dinners from another jarred brand (or mixing my own).  Id really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!The Earths Best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great - just check the label to make sure water isnt the first ingredient listed (I just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up). As I have with all other Earths Best jarred baby food, I wont be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earths Bests consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earths Best baby food jar lids contains \"trace amounts\" of BPA, but it \"doesnt come into direct contact with the food.\"  That kind of lukewarm response wasnt enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess Ill have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earths Best rep did say that they were doing \"accelerated testing\" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).This is such a shame, because Earths Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ellas Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earths Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesnt include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess Ill have to wait until shes old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (Virtually impossible for this super-busy and domestically-challenged mom, LOL!) Amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on-time, but, I guess this is one product that they can not.Several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out.  I wish I could order this by mail but it seems this is one item well need to go to the grocery store for. I was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. I wasnt really impressed when my son tried the food. The consistency was WAY too thin, and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. I would recommend making your own baby food, or use the Gerber organic. My baby didnt seem into these dinners, so I tried them. Theyre not terrible, but not good either. Well stick with the EB fruits and veggies until shes ready for table foods. We ordered the Earths best 2nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack.  We got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack, not the dinner pack.  Found out we cant return the item, either.  We will try the Amazon phone help, but if all else fails maybe my little one will like this stuff... Just off the phone with them (Aug/12) and they said that yes they stopped putting BPA in the liners in Oct/11. Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the \"old\" (with BPA) or the \"new\" (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid. If it is all white then it is BPA free - if it is metallic or gold then its the \"old\" lids which did contain a BPA layer. Thought this might help some of you out there! I usually feed Earths Best baby food to my grandson. He has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food I have given him. This is the first time I have tried this particular variety pack. I fed him the Peach Oatmeal Banana and Apples and Apricots for breakfast this morning. Shortly after I noticed he was scratching. I looked and he had a rash. I remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so I checked and yes it is this variety pack. I dont know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction. Unfortunately I fed him two different jars so I dont know which one caused it but I dont want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go. Just thought I would let others know. Amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on-time, but, I guess this is one product that they can not.Several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out.  I wish I could order this by mail but it seems this is one item well need to go to the grocery store for. I love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet.The combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst  without leaving an unpleant after taste. t Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent.  I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact, I purchased it in its original larger size jar.  When the size was decreased to 8.82 OZ,  the selling price remained the same at Whole Foods.  I also purchased ALL flavors as this product is really delicious.The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is always another price increase.My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted???  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Of course there is the additional shipping chg.  On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.I gave the product a low rating, even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly OVERPRICED. They have some textured powder stuff on them that makes them taste bad.. bad after taste. I guess its so they dont stick together. Never again The taste is not horrible but it is not very good. There is not a very good mango flavor. I would not buy again. this egg pasta ingredient was \"powdered egg product\" and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing.  i dont like anything powdered, but price was RIGHT.  cant have it all i guess. The picture and description was Pure Butter Mini Shortbread Round, then I decided to order it because I love them so bad. But when i got the package, it came out at Mini CHOCOLATE CHIP shortbread which I dont like. When Habanero is in powder form it doesnt taste the same nor does it have the same heat. Its almost physically impossible to get a Habanero powder to taste decent. Go with Habanero flakes instead. They taste better and pack a lot more heat. I have a tried a few of these Wasa crisp breads.  This one was by far the worst.  It was in essence entirely flavorless.  It tasted to me the way that I expect that those little packing Styrofoam peanuts would taste.Dont get me wrong it didnt taste bad, hence the 2 stars, it just didnt taste like anything.  Looking for a low-cal snack type cracker?  Try the Wasa Sourdough Rye crackers.  Now those are heavenly! This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadnt known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking Id brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidsons Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I havent thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Liptons bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I dont really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidsons ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant. Just on this particular Darjeeling. The price is right. Organic Tea at a great price, but thats as far as it goes. Ive tried about 5 of the Davidsons so far and they just lack character. She liked the food a little at first but didnt want much to do with it... The price is very high and not worth it if shell only eat a couple of bites. She had tried most of the flavors and would always have the same reaction. I purchased these beans based on other reviews.  My plan was to make a Premium Vanilla Extract for family members.  I purchased a very expensive Vodka, unusual bottles to fill, and waited for my bean order to arrive.  I wasnt happy about the wait.  The beans arrived after the 4th, and I rushed to open the package.  I could not smell the beans as others reported!  Most of the beans were skinny/shriveled, more dry, and a great disappointment.  I Would Not recommend this product.  I will be looking for another source. True, the beans were huge, moist and plump, with a good mixture of really big fat ones and smaller skinny ones.  However, the most noticeable aroma coming from the bag and the beans is best described as pungent, with a side of sour.  Is that normal?!?  Ive only ever used the crappy dried out grocery store version, and was THRILLED when I saw such a good deal on these.Can a vanilla bean expert tell me if that odd, unpleasant aroma is what Im supposed to be smelling?? I really wanted a decaf product so didnt have a lot of options. This powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink, even when I use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the \"base\", the chocolate is what you taste. When I think of an iced coffee drink, I think of coffee with a hint of chocolate (mocha) not the other way around.As other reviewers point out, the 150 calories is for half the packet and no milk added.I will try a different brand next time. Im still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor Ive experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop. Or like the iced blended at a west coast chain (CB&TL) that is overpriced to have shipped (and I think is available sugar free)! I really wanted to like this, as it was organic, and came in a glass bottle, but there was hardly any flavor at all. I could barely smell it, and even when I poured a generous amount on my dish, it imparts little to no truffle flavor/aroma. My truffle salt is much more potent. Personal preference... too sweet.  Tastes like General Foods International Coffees.  Price is great if you like that, though.  And makes up very easy. I love Taco Bells grocery items, so I was excited to try this new rice. Unfortunately, it was disappointing. This is more of an imitation Spanish rice than a Mexican rice. It is tomato based, and very sweet. I expected it to have more of a taco type seasoning (cumin, garlic, etc).I cooked the rice for the recommended amount of time (90 seconds) and this came out very mushy and sticky, mostly clumping together. The flavor was too much for me, since I do not like sweet rice with my tacos. I would not try this again, and I would be hesitant to try another flavor. I dont think its EB, I think its Amazon. I buy EB from Babies R Us, Target and Whole Foods, and havent had any problems. Its only the shipments from Amazon that come moldy. I also ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now Im so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earths Best and they assured me that they havent had this problem before and that I shouldnt worry about it.  Im so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?! We had the same issue with this product. Half the flat was improperly sealed, and resulted in an expired food issue.  But you can spot the unsafe jars because they have dried up & turned solid, resulting in a different sound when shaken.  Also, when opened, these \"bad\" jars are mounded up in the middle and have a rotten smell.  It may be that the product was frozen in shipping, and the expansion caused the seal to break.  I have requested a refund from Amazon.Our baby did love this meal though - it was like Thanksgiving dinner.  The ones that were still edible were delicious, and are one of his favorite foods. This was NOT a hit!  Its bitter, like maybe the carrots were not sweet and/or not peeled?  and the main ingredient is carrots! (amazon should include the ingredients for all items) Quality control seems to be an issue. This is the second \"gourmet meal\" flavor with this issue. I had never had a bad experience with the EB products before, very disappointing. My girls seem to like this food - theyve only ever shown an opposition to green beans.  But it is SO messy.  Its apparently tomato-based, and it gets everywhere.  Where we usually just wipe their faces gently, you really have to clean them.  It simply turns their skin orange.  And the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily, even after soaking. My 9 mo. old daughter only eats earths best products and loves all of them - that is, except this. I cant figure out what it is, but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood. I tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites. I gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone elses child would like it. I have had a good experience with the \"subscribe and save\" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons). This is the only flavor of earths best baby food that my daughter dislikes. For what its worth, I suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first. This is for puppies the bag is super small!!!The bag didnt last more than a day. I thought it was funny when I got the bag I thought it was a gift to be honest!!! Several of the sellers listings indicate 20% Kona blend.....but the delivered product does NOT have this package printing.As a long-time Kona coffee drinker, the contents are more indicative of 10% (or less) Kona coffee. Have ordered twice....and completely disappointed. Very bitter!  I couldnt taste the coffee at all.  It basically tastes like baking cocoa.  No sweetness, no richness, not coffee.  I bought the 4 pack though, so Ive begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after Ive made a cup.  Even making it with whole milk couldnt make this yummy by itself.  If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere. Having liked the various types of Ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoas I decided to try some Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Chocolate Mocha. After trying several cups of this I started to wonder what happened to the Ghirardelli Chocolate as myself I thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste. Not my cup of hot cocoa!! Not really sure what I expected, but since I like Ghirardelli chocolate, and I like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops, I thought Id like this product.Unfortunately, despite following the directions and making this in milk, its not as rich and satifying as I hoped.  I hate to say it, but I think Swiss Miss mixed Instant coffee tastes better than this.Thats unfortunate, because this is a four pack of cannisters and Im only half way through the first one! I tried this carrot juice for the first time today and regret buying it.  I took my first sip and actually wondered if someone had put pickle juice in the jar.  It was awful.  Ive had several carrot juices and never had any as sour as this.  It is difficult to fathom how this product is still produced.  It has lemon juice in it, but apparently far far too much.  If you enjoy pickle juice with your carrot juice, you will love this product.  I dont. This stuff does not taste like black licorice or sweet in any way to me.  It tastes kind of like thick, nasty soy sauce.  I cant see how anyone could take 3 tablespoons a week of this.  I barely managed to swallow the teaspoon I put in my mouth.  We eat very healthy and not much sugar but my tastebuds say \"no way!\" to this stuff.  It does have 70% of your daily iron so I will make some attempts to hide this in something else- though I really cant imagine what right now.In addition, the cap was not on tightly when the package arrived and the black goo had leaked out into into the packaging.  They did have it wrapped securely in bubble wrap though, so it only got on that.  Still, not pleasant to have to clean the container before I could open it. The shipping was very prompt and the packaging excellent.  All other items in this order were excellent.  These were lollipops shaped and \"painted\" like flamingos.  But you have to hold them up close to the eye to figure out what they are!  Theyll be \"OK\" to set out on the candy buffet, but they wont be the eye-catching item wed anticipated when we ordered. The first ingredient is vinegar. Anyone who uses hot sauce religiously should understand what that means. I read the other reviews and was expecting a hell of a lot more than what I got. Its got a good flavor to it, but its just a few steps above tabasco. From what the other reviewers described, it seems this product has a LOT of variability in heat, which means its going to have a lot of variability in quality. The bottle I got is really tame, far, far below my Daves Ghost Pepper, Daves Ultimate Insanity, Blairs After Death, Da Bomb Beyond Insanity, Da Bomb Ground Zero, Professor Phardtpounders Colon Cleanser, its a lacking sauce. Hell, Sriracha is hotter than this. If you get lucky and get a hot bottle, congrats. I use mine liberally on cheap pizza, because thats all its good for. I bought the kit to dabble in spherification. The item is as-described and arrived on time. My complaint is that the instructions measure the required chemicals in fractions of grams. My kitchen scale measures as low as 1 gram but does not do fractions of grams. I cannot find a kitchen scale that measures fractions of grams. Therefore I find the kit difficult to use. I would not recommend the kit because it requires the purchase of specialized scale that can measure tenths of grams. This is not a deeply roasted or rich tasting coffee at all.  Its very light, with unevenly sized beans -- clearly a blend.  Some beans are normal size and some are tiny.  The hazelnut aroma and flavor is good, but this coffee is not strong at all -- even using twice as many grounds, I could not get enough coffee flavor from these beans.People who like very weak coffee will probably love this.  People who like Starbucks will not like this one bit. I blame myself for trying to save a buck - this coffee is way too weak for my tastebuds - they say its a dark blend but its not even close to a dark roast I buy at stores.  In the end, I have blend each can with a pound of dark roast and its OK. If you like a rich dark coffee, this product is NOT for you!  Wed been looking for an organic alternative, and Ive tried some great ones, so we ordered this when it was on special.  Unfortunately, we ordered 6 cans to get the discount, and now we are stuck with organic, but very dull tasting coffee.  To make the best of it, weve bought other tried and true rich dark brands to mix with it.  Very disappointing! so so.there was great reviews on product only made it once will try it again Im recently widowed so have to learn to fix for a single person. I hoped this microwaveable bowl of \"Beefaroni\" would provide a tasty lunch. To my surprise, I found that it was nearly all macaroni, with some tomato sauce and a very small amount of beef. The taste was OK if you like macaroni and a rather strong tomato sauce, but I expected more beef. Also, as with so many canned food these days, be prepared for a high dose of sodium -- salt, that is -- 31% of average daily requirement in one small serving. Overall, no so good. Too soft: I just used this sugar to bake one of the layers for a firm pound cake-like layer cake intended for decoration (Wilton Butter cake recipe). This is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well. I had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before I ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar. Be forewarned, this sugar makes cakes far too tender. The layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release. Even when I was mixing the batter, it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out. Im sure this is good for meringues and such, but I would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies. You would never get them out of or off the pan. The seeds are fresh, the shells are hard and the seeds are JUMBO sized.  The taste is good, but the over-powering amount of salt ruins the experience.  The ranch flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened.  Then again, without the overwhelming amount of salt, David might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying.  By the way, I dont often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny regular sized sunflower seeds by David.I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the Davids have.Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back-to-back.  The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to Davids.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.  Right now, they seem a bit under-flavored.  Still, that is preferable to Davids overuse of salt. The product is a good value for the amount you get, however it is way too salty.  The product is very dry and firm.  I think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half. I love all different types of beef jerky, but not this one.  It has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt. These sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew, but theyre just way too salty and definitely not worth $20 I read the reviews and thought, I like salt. I thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky.  There is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew. The strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil. 12 ounces for $20+ is way too expensive.  There is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt.  These taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty. The amount of salt made my tongue numb, if you want good jerky keep looking. (Jack Links Smokehouse Beef jerky strips, wood smoked 30-count jar) too salty -- enough said. I order the wood smoked 30-count jar. Remember, the price is for only ONE JAR (not two). I like almost everything about this jerky, the toughness and chewiness. But it is just too salty. If you nibble it, you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat. Also, it is not good for my health to eat something this salty. I have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently. This review is for the wood smoked, but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving, they will be just as salty. Why everything is either too fatty, sweet or salty??? Are they trying to get us addicted? I buy jerky all the time, always willing to try something new. Ive even made my own at home. I agree with the review that called these salt sticks, they are way too salty for my taste. Also, being a jerky eater for 40+ years, I eat it because i like the toughness and chewiness of jerk. But the tube I got was nearly un-chewable. I have bit into some hard jerky in my time, but jeez louise, these were literally like chewing leather, many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite. this is a good name and a good value; the texture and size of the jerky is fine,but be prepared for the salt. It ruined it for me. I did not realize when I decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that I found them stale and hard.  I had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh.  Sorry that I could not give these a better review. I havent had a cat yet that liked this one.  Its just a little too interesting for them I think.  It smells nasty but I think its just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just wont touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if hes REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, dont try this one. In Christmas, 2010 I first ordered Clayton Fruit Cakes. They where great! Nice big cherries and other fruits and nuts. These were overloaded with the good stuff that makes a Fruit cake really great. So I re-ordered in Christmas of 2011. What a disappointment! I ordered 5 one pound cakes. When my order arrived, I was so excited. Yes I like fruit cake. Only too be very disappointed. Not only where the cakes void of very much fruit, unless you want too count the raisons as fruit. I will not be ordering Clayton Fruit Cakes next year. I can get the same results from a Hostess Fruit cake, and only spend $3.50, instead of close to 30 dollars for the Clayton cakes. The flavor is decent (berry vanilla), but I just cant handle the texture.  Its like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it.  Ive been gluten free for about 6 years, and there are much better products out there.  My kids wont even eat these! I love the other Nanas cookie bars and cookies, so I thought Id give these a try even though they are \"No Gluten\" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (its kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They dont taste bad, which is a plus, but I wont be buying these again. tastes like dry brownie w/ invisible pieces of puffed rice which get stuck in your teeth. come on. we can do better than this for cookie bars. THis product is definitely not as good as some other gluten free cookies!  Try Pamelas! I was a bit disappointed in these.  They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture.  My son (6) does not like them. This devices lid does not seal.  I am not sure why it is being sold as anything other than a trashcan.  Did work well for beer as long as it was transferred to a secondary right at the end of fermentation. Ive noticed that my dog has had more frequent bowel movement than usual. He is on a strict schedule for potty break and has been very good on it for the past 4 years until i tried this food. Now he poops in my apt in front of us because he has to go so bad, like the poster above, its one hell of a laxative when my very well trained yorkie cant even hold it in I started giving my dog this a couple of weeks ago. He really loved a different Beneful and so I gave this one a try. He LOVES it and is excited when its time to eat. (He would barely touch Purina Little Bites) I took him out of state to my moms place and he pooped in the house 3 times! I took the blame for not paying enough attention to him. However, since weve come back home hes pooped in my apt 3 times! (in 1 week) He NEVER does that. I thought that maybe he was being spiteful, but I really think he just cant help it. The food is one hell of a laxative if thats what youre looking for. Im glad I only bought the small bag because I WILL NOT be giving this one another try. It only gets 2 stars because he likes it and because Im sure he would lose weight if he keeps pooping this much. TERRIBLE. This is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea.  Sometimes convenience outweighs taste, but not always.  What this product doesnt tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are: black tea with tea extract, hibiscus and citric acid.  Its not just tea.  And it doesnt taste like just tea, either.  It tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar.  It has an overtaste of lemon -- thats probably the citric acid.  And that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix.  Ill probably drink it when its really convenient.  But I wont serve it to friends!  And I wont drink it if I have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice. Not a big fan.  Will not buy this again.  plus she eats it really quick too, other than the throw up part. These taste great!  And its true what other reviewers have said about the consistency being good and them not sticking in your teeth.  However, as an energy boost for running, they dont do a thing for me.  In fact, they actually cause a stitch.  So I just eat them whenever I feel I need a sugary fix. Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isnt 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldnt have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but Im not a fan. I was surprised at the ingredient list and \"100% natural\" stamped on the side, because this drink tasted just like a compeletely artifical energy drink. This is going to be a short review for me, because I dont really have much else to say. I could barely tell it was orange, because as with energy drinks it just tastes like an amalgamation of fruits. My wife was especially confused- she gets sick at the smell of drinks like Monster, and she had the exact same reaction here.I know this isnt an energy drink, but for the life of me, I just cant reconcile the taste with the ingredients. If youre the sort of person who drinks some fresh fruit juice and thinks \"I really wish this tasted more like a completely artifical enegry drink instead of natural fruit juice\", then this is the product youve been dreaming of. Switch Orange/Tangerine is billed as the natural alternative to sodas and/or artificially-sweetened juice drinks.  However, I found it to be pretty ordinary.First the good stuff: It is 100% Orange & Tangerine juice, has no sweetners, is 100% natural, has 100% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, and has a nice carbonation tang to it.  If you are health conscious and want to drink something like a soda w/o actually drinking a soda, this would probably be right down your alley.However, I found the taste to be somewhat... odd.  I could definitely taste the tangerine in it mixed with the orange, but the combination of the two or the bottling or something gives this Switch a taste akin to eating an orange that is ALMOST too ripe.  You know that kind of fermented taste of an orange that you need to eat NOW because by tomorrow youll need to put out for the birds?  Not exactly something that Id look forward to drinking.So for me, although this was somewhat good, its not exactly something I would get again.  Im not really a health nut so if I wanted an orange soda, Id just go out and get an Orange Crush. This drink contends to be a natural alternative to soda.  While it definitely is \"natural\", I would not agree with the \"alternative to soda\" aspect.  Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces).  Sure, its lightly carbonated, but that alone doesnt make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, Id go with Hansens sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesnt get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you dont get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldnt make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldnt give this to my kids.  Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them.Not recommended, sorry. Switch is a tangy drink thats more reminiscent of Sprite than Orange Juice. Its carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you wouldve after consuming any soft drink. The drink doesnt feel sugary, but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains 34 grams of sugar. The claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added, so Im assuming thats the sugar from the orange and tangerine. The can If you like Orange Crush you may become a fan, but its too much of a hybrid for me. The main two ingredients are reconstituted apple and grape juices. It contains something called Acerola juice, which is high in Vitamin C (and indeed the can contains 100% of your C and 20% of your A).The sugar content is high---34 grams---which brings the carb percentage up to 12% for the day and the calorie count to 140. I think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to \"spend\" them on Switch, which almost tastes like carbonated TANG.  Ive tried the Ooba drinks, and they are much lighter and more refreshing. Guess Im just not ready to make the Switch! The product may be every bit as healthy as they claim, but even if thats true, I could barley get down one can of this stuff.  It tastes like sour orange juice with some carbonation in it.  It doesnt taste anything like orange soda, and the taste it does have isnt very pleasant.  Also leaves a very nasty aftertaste, and like many sodas, this will leave you more thirsty than when you started drinking.  All in all, I cannot recommend this.  Stay away. I was looking forward to tasting the Switch Orange Tangerine drink since orange and tangerine flavors are two of my favorite but I was disappointed in the result.It was tangy. It tasted of ascorbic acid. It smelled of orange candy. It reminded me of breakfast. It reminded me of, yes, powdered Tang mixed with carbonated water followed by a strong unpleasant artificial aftertaste.  I found the the drink to be, simply, not very good.I tried to like the beverage and I did appreciate the concept but considering the unusual flavors, high calorie count of 140 cals/8.5 oz, and cost of almost a dollar/serving -- I cannot recommend Switch. Ive become a fan of The Switch sodas. The black cherry flavor has a great balance of flavoring and carbonation that had me ready to give up traditional sodas. The Orange flavor; however, leaves a lot to be desired. It has a really strong after taste and despite being \"100% juice\" it tastes like bad artificial Orange flavoring.Id opt for the grape or the black cherry for sure. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E\">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>Also, youll want to note that The Switch sodas arent exactly healthy, they are simply not overrun with artificial flavors. They actually have a fairly high calorie count. That being said they have some health benefits over pop- like the vitamin count and no added sugars. This is for sure not what I was expecting it to taste like. Its not bad but not for me. I like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar. When I first took a sip of it I noticed it has a bite to it. The best way I can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne. I however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me. This product advertises that it is a soda made from 100% fruit juices and is refreshing.  I was quite disapointed in the flavor. If you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned (not refrigerated or fresh squeezed) OJ you know there is a HUGE differance in flavor. The bad, almost rotting component is carried over into this soda. IT even carries a rather odd aftertaste. I was not able to finish the entire can.This may be a feature of the Orange flavor. Other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good. But I recommend skilling the orange version. My daughter & I were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice.  This product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more. My son also tried it and didnt care for it. The orange tangerine flavors are masked by the other fruit juices and makes it taste odd.  I like the fact that has added Vitamin C and is a healthy alternative to sodas but the flavor on this one needs tweaking. I wasnt sure what to expect with this citrusy, fizzy drink. It was okay, though not something Id buy often, and certainly not worth the price in my opinion.It wasnt as orangey as I expected and it wasnt until I had half of it gone that I read the ingredient list and saw why--orange juice is actually the fourth juice listed on the ingredient list, with apple and grape juice first and second, and the tangerine that seems to tone down the sweetness slightly the third on the list.When you look at the nutrition information, this product has about forty more calories than Coke Classic, and despite not having any *added* sugar, the grams of sugar in this product is MORE than an equivalent amount of Coca-Cola!! The only bonus of this over \"real\" soda is the Vitamin C and A...there isnt much else nutritionally to speak of. I did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste; it is orange juice infused with carbonation. The juice is quite acidic and you dont feel that there is 100% fruit juice. The drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer. It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. This drink doesnt have any special features and it doesnt stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks.1. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK\">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q3ECXM\">Minute Maid Mixed Berry Juice, 24 - 10 fl oz Bottles, 240 fl oz</a>3. Cal Valls Certified Organic Juices - Clementine (24 fluid ounce) by igourmet.com The product says a twist because of carbonation. Well after pouring the drink over 3 pieces of ice the carbonation was gone.  The carbonation is definitely light and does not last.As far as the taste goes I did not care for the taste at all. It left a bad after taste in my mouth I cannot recommend this product. I will stick with regular juice at a much lower cost.To be fair I gave it two stars because my wife thought it was OK. This tastes like carbonated orange juice, very tart.  It is very expensive compared to easier-to-find similar beverages.  If one had allergies or health issues, it might be worth drinking. I have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners, and this includes sodas with high fructose corn syrup.  The Switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners--not even cane sugar.  It has carbonated water, fruit juice, some natural flavors and colors, and vitamin C.  If youre going to drink soda, carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go.The Switch has several flavors, including Orange Tangerine.  However, its clear some flavors are better than others.  The Orange Tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor I tried does not.  Ive tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them, but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda.  If youre looking for an orangey soda, try Izzes Sparking Clementine instead. Described as an alternative to soda, Switch is a carbonated fruit drink made from 100% natural juices (although not necessarily the ones listed as the flavor).  Made mostly out of apple and grape juice, The Switch Orange Tangerine does in fact have an (oversweet)orange-tangerine flavor -- followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste. It tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed Flintstone vitamins.Want a better carbonated fruit drink?  Pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda. I like the idea of a healthy soda type drink, but this flavor just missed the mark. The tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth. Carbonated juice is a great idea, they just need to tweak the flavors a bit.Ranking the Switch drinks from best to worst:1. Watermelon Strawberry2. Kiwi Berry3. Black Cherry4. Orange Tangerine The can says its 100% juice, but the taste is ...powdery.  If youve ever had a glass of Kool-Aid or Crystal Light, youll know what I mean.So theres that from powder taste; also there is an aftertaste.  And all comes in a can the size of a Red Bull for 160 calories.I did not like it. This 100% juice, carbonated beverage is a good alternative to traditional soda. As a somewhat health-conscious consumer, I avoid high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as much as possible. This beverage contains no HFCS, no added sugar, no preservatives, and no added color. Im sampling the orange flavor. It contains 100% of your daily recommended dose of Vitamin C, and 20% of your Vitamin A for the day. The downside is a single 8.3 fl oz can contains almost as many calories as a 12 oz a can of soda.The Orange-Tangerine flavor reminds me a bit of Orangina. Perhaps youve tried Crystal Geysers Fruit Squeeze beverages which are also similar. Its definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages (Sunkist, Crush). It has a hint of grapefruit-like taste to it, but without the bitterness, which may be due to the added apple, grape, and acerola concentrates. The aftertaste is a bit metallic to me. The beverage itself is clear - without pulp of any kind - and is light-orange-yellow in color.This is a good alternative to those looking for something soda-like, but healthier than all the HFCS-loaded options. Maybe its a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway. Personally, I dont enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available, similar products. If I want orange juice or crave soda, Ill rather drink the real thing. I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isnt enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasnt anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money. Im a fan of all-natural anything, especially when its a tasty and healthy alternative to something Ive enjoyed my whole life, but I know is bad for me.Regular soda is one of those bad things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when Im also getting 150 empty calories on average.And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, theres nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other all natural ingredients.Thats great.So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can taste the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.Moreover, this doesnt have that bold pop to it as other carbonated beverages have.  Ive had mineral water with more bite.But the worse part about this good for me drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, Id rather take them directly from the source: an orange.Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply dont justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas. If you think this is going to be a healthy product, you are sadly mistaken. It still contains 36g of sugar per can!  If you want to end up a fat diabetic, by all means, try it. Otherwise, try the ZERO CALORIE, ZERO SUGAR, ZERO CHEMICAL naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by La Croix. This had a nice citrus flavor, but it was too sweet and actually flat. I did not get any kind of fizz or sparkle. For the amount of sugar and calories, I rather would have eaten a piece of fruit and drank a glass of seltzer water - less calories and more satisfying in my mouth. I got this on GB special for about $13.52 for the case. I dont think I will purchase again. I was anxious to try this, but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp/harsh citrus-y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness, the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.  So when they claim \"no additional sugar\" this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar... but it does in fact have 34 grams. This is my second can of \"The Switch\" that Im reviewing under the Amazon Vine program. And while this one is perhaps a bit better it still has the same basic issues -- its over priced at almost $1 for a mere 8.3oz can in a 24 pack, but more importantly it really just doesnt taste like orange or tangerine at all. The ingredients actually list apple juice as the first type. Now why would you put apple juice in an orange drink? Now dont get me wrong, it tastes exactly like one would expect carbonated juice to taste...but the flavor isnt all that appealing.I love orange juice, drink it every day. Id love to try carbonated orange juice...but this is far from that. It MIGHT be a good substitute for normal soda for kids, but I cant imagine any other real reason to get this. I suspect this drink is an acquired taste. After the first sip, I was reluctant to take another. The second sip was an improvement and the third even more so. By the end of the can, I was finding it fairly enjoyable.It was only after I had finished that I noted the Alka Seltzer-like aftermath. Yuck.Still, I am sure I could get used to it after a few more tries. This is, I think, the problem with the drink: I would drink it because it presents itself as being good for me, not because I was blown away with taste or a feeling of refreshment.I would not buy it again. Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks  no caffeine  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)  cant taste the orange or tangerine juices in it  lots of caloriesI grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents trees.  I was surprised that I couldnt taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.Ill stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - Id rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor. I grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a healthy Crush. That would be a NO. Of course, tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as its that much sweeter. Adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy, ultra sweet drink, not unlike cough syrup. Proceed with caution. Perhaps kids would find it super tasty. Switch tastes more like chemicals than juice. I was expecting something along the lines of Orangina, instead its closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable. For a small drink (8.3 oz), its pretty high in calories (140). Frankly, I dont think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level.Bottom line: If youre die-hard soda drinker, this might be a better option for you. If youre a die-hard juice drinker, stick to juice. If you want fizzy juice, add a little seltzer to your fruit juice. 8.3 ounces and a tad expensive is what Id say about this drink.34 grams of sugar is also a negative for me. Im not a sugar lover. All in all not big enough to quench my thirst,and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more.Natural but not that intensely citrus. I thought it would have a clean, crisp taste, but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda Ive ever had.  Maybe thats deliberate; maybe theyre targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda, unless presented with a more \"natural\" alternative...  Regardless, it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates, with some orange coloring thrown into the mix, i.e., nothing special. The only good thing was that it was not sweet, but the taste was just bad. I could understand and tolerate the taste if it was an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink.  I have been very open and have tried different carbonated orange drinks, and I have to say this is the least favorites of the 9 other carbonated orange drinks.  I prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice. The Switch Orange Tangerine sounded delicious when I ordered it. I thought it would be very refreshing on these hot summer days. And it would be if the taste were better. Perhaps the other flavors might be better but the orange tangerine had a bad aftertaste. Stick with the real juice if you want that flavor. The sparkling juice idea is good, I liked the carbonation as it was refreshing.But the biggest drawback for me is the sugar. There was 34g of sugar in that little 8 oz. can. There is 40g in a 12 oz. can of Dr. Pepper. Way too much sugar.The other drawback for me is the price. I wouldnt buy it because it works out to be almost a dollar a can. If Im going to pay that much, I would rather buy the regular juice (real, not reconstituted) in the store. Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common \"fruit\" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of \"fructose\" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.So another drink on the hit parade of \"pretend\" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract. The carbonation in this drink was way too much. So much in fact, that it over powered the flavor. (Orange-tangerine is usually very good together).  I expect this from a soda, but not a \"healthy\" drink. Lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink. Until then, Ill pass. On the face of it, THE SWITCH Orange Tangerine beverage sounds quite good. Its a mix of concentrated fruit juices with mildly carbonated water. No added sugar, preservatives or caffeine are there to annoy the health-conscious. You get 140 calories from one 8.3 ounce can. (Probably too small a serving for most people.) There are small portions of natural flavor and coloring, gum acacia, ascorbic acid (i.e., Vitamin C) and soy. In case quantities, its priced at under a dollar per can. Sounds pretty decent, right?The trouble is: it just doesnt taste that good to me. There is a vaguely unpleasant metallic quality to this stuff that I cant imagine many people warming up to. Perhaps the juice has reacted with the aluminum of the can. Perhaps my can had been sitting on the shelf for too long. Perhaps the acerola juice in the mix is an acquired taste; its something I havent tried before. Perhaps I got a bum can. Perhaps THE SWITCH just plain sucks. I really dont know, but I do know that I wont be drinking any more of it in the near future. This drink is very, very sweet, and only mildly carbonated.I dont drink soda, but i do occasionally like bubbles in my drinks. I had some hope that Switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need, but its not. The ingredients may be all-natural, but its still syrupy, and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin C.For regular soda drinkers, the sweetness may not be as offensive, but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice, this will be a disappointment. Id still choose this over an orange soda, but id choose to have nothing at all rather than this.Also, note that the cans are only 8.3 ounces each, smaller than normal 12oz soda cans. While orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink,  the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation.  I think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients (tangerine is third) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste. Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely \"natural\" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you. I ordered this product after enjoying a previous Vine acquisition--<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094JEUO\">Izze Sparkling Clementine Soda Full Case (24 12oz Bottles)</a>--fully expecting to like it.  It appears that the use of 100% juice in this product makes a big difference from the Izzes use of 70% juice/30% sparkling water.  I like Izze, but do not like Switch much.Switch tastes -- and is -- just like orange juice, except it is carbonated.  I do not think orange juice was meant to be carbonated.  It just doesnt add anything to the taste or consistency that I found enjoyable.  It also left a lengthy aftertaste of juice burps which I did not enjoy.  So it is not that the makes have done anything wrong or poor quality, it is just that this reviewer did not like how the concept worked out. well, my husband, myself and my 12 year old son sampled this drink. My husband hated it. I felt like it was OK, but nothing to write home about. The taste to me was too orangey and for a \"natural\" product it sure didnt taste like one. My 12 year old liked it. He also likes gummy worms and sour straws, so you can take his review for what it is.I personally wouldnt buy this product.2 stars To be blunt, I was throughly underwhelmed with this product and I am finding it hard to come up the words to describe why, but the problem is that orange SWITCH doesnt have a lot going for it, so there isnt a lot one can say about it.To me, this product is canned orange juice and club soda, packaged in a trendy little can.And like all canned orange juice (Blue Bird brand, et. al.) there is an off taste to it that reminds you it isnt fresh squeezed juice.  Add to that this fizzy aspect, and its just kinda, well, there.I cant say that this is a healthy drink - orange juice has some of the highest concentrations of sugars for a fruit drink.  And its cost per can is steep, especially when compared to making this stuff at home with club soda and fresh squeezed juice.I cant give it one star - I would reserve that for something undrinkable as Amazon requires a minimum one star to do a review.  So my two star rating should be taken to mean that you can drink it and its unoffensive, but thats about all you can say about it. The only way we could make Switch Orange-Tangerine drinkable was mixing 50/50 with club soda. It was just way too sweet. It then tasted good, but Orangina and San Pelligrino both have awesome Orange flavored sodas out there with no need to mix! And surprisingly, imported San Pelligrino comes out to be cheaper because the cans are larger (11.3 oz. as opposed to 8 oz). When I saw the Switch Orange Tangerine was available, I knew I had to try it.  I liked the Kiwi Strawberry quite well (better than some other reviewers did, it seems), so I was sure I would enjoy this one just as much.The initial taste of this Orange Tangerine carbonated juice is rather tart, and the carbonation just seems to make it more tart.  The aftertaste is rather pleasant, so if the aftertaste is what youre looking for in a drink, this is the drink for you.  My wife thought it tasted a bit like champagne, if thats any indication of what to expect from this drink.The flavor is different, and not at all what I expected.  Not very refreshing at all.  I would buy the Kiwi Berry drink, but I think Ill take a pass on the Orange Tangerine in the future. This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be \"100% juice,\" but this drink has some kick.There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldnt cute into the sugary flavor.It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you. These seemed like a great idea. I would be able to load up 50 k-cups with any type of coffee I chose, and still maintain the speed of using the store bought cups in my rush to get ready every morning. After waiting a month for this product to reach me (20 days before they even shipped it!) I finally found it on my doorstep.Upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher; these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than I expected. I filled one and snapped the lid down. I ensured it was sealed all the way around, placed it in my Kuerig, and hit the brew button. At first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it isnt supposed to. By the time it was over I had quite a mess to clean up. Upon opening the Kuerig I found the DisposaKup completely in tact and the lid still secured properly. However the bit of overhanging filter was soaked, dripping, and HOT! I had discovered the source of the leak. I have tried again several times with the same reoccurring problem. I guess I should have bought the EcoBrew cup after all.If you like the appearance of convenience, and the reality of spending more time cleaning up a mess this is the product for you.(I went ahead and gave it two stars because I like the idea of the product so much.) The first shipment I received of this item was great. Lids fit easily. This last shipment, either the lids are slightly larger or the cups are smaller. The lids are extremely hard to get on. If I press too hard the cup starts to buckle. Ive actually started to use a pair of pliers to get the lids on! I decided to give these a try.  The lids are VERY difficult to put on and I often ended up bending the cup while trying to affix the lid.  They do not seal perfectly and I often found unexpected puddles, but they do the job.  Since I have a Keurig permanant filter I thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup.  For almost $11 from this vendor, you can get 50 (fifty) paper filters.....I would just assume use paper towels.  That works out to be just under 25 cents for a small piece of paper....DisposaKups, please re-evaluate your pricing! Caused my cuisinart k-cup brewer to leak every time I used it.  Great idea, just needs some adjustments so that the coffee maker works properly with it. Bought a pack of a 100 of these and each cup it takes so long to process the coffee.. Each cup I get coffee grounds in and not a whole cup of coffee.. Great concept, I believe the paper filter is to fine which holds back the coffee and pressure which results in bleeding of coffee grounds out of the 2 other holes.. Regular K Cups work work much better.. Again great idea, just not so great of a product.. First of all, I thought I could save money filling my own Keurig K-Cups. By the time I bought the fillable cups, paid shipping and bought coffee to put in them, I was already in the hole.If all you have to do is fill these little cups all day I guess it will work for you, because you can have the coffee of your choice. The other problem was is they get stuck in the brewer when you try to take them out.I still have about thirty left, and when they are gone I will not replace them. The basic problem with this product is that unless you load a VERY small amount of coffee in the filter, the filter clogs.  This causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess.  My son and I spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat.  I suspected the filter but I used filters which work perfectly fine in my EZ Cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter. Even worse, coffee grounds in my coffee!  However, if you like your coffee very weak, this will work well for you.  I hope they can fix the design issues.  Until then, I will stick with my EZ Cup. Thought this might be a nice alternative to use with my favorite coffee, but was sadly disappointed.  It leaked all over - no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak, machine clogged with most attempts and water wouldnt brew thru.  At times the cup even melted a little - leaving a nasty taste in the coffee.Go with the greener alternative and try the ekobrew - much better results and no waste. I purchased this item as an alternative to traditional K-cups in an attempt to save money; however, this product did not work well in my machine. I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K-cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively. Maybe I am not doing something correctly, but Im sure there is also an issue with the product itself. While I do like the idea, I would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out. I thought I was purchasing a high quality item but its not all that. The chocolate is very sweet and as you chew on this product you can tell the chocolate is loaded with sugar by the crunchy texture. Im going to say its not worth the money and Im not satisfied.At the same time of purchasing this product I also bought Sunmaid chocolate covered raisons which I rate from a 1-10...a 10. Now we are talking about yumminess!!!!!So customers...if you are going to choose...let it be the Sunmaid...you wont be dissappointed I eat mixed nuts all the time at work. They make a healthy snack instead of the donuts, etc. that are always around. The plus side of these is that they are much lower salt than usual. The down side is that they are almost all cashews. Very few brazil nuts, pecans and it is a miracle to find a macadamia nut. The lack of variety is disappointing. The price was comparable to Walmart for same size product.  However these nuts were not as crunchy; and they needed a little more salt. I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts.  These are just average quality, and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful.  The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans.  There are barely any pecans, but tons of cashews.  Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there. All of the positive reviews led me to believe this popcorn was going to be really great. Truth is, I am disappointed. The popcorn kernels are tough, chewy and lack any great corn taste. I want popcorn that snaps when you bite into it.  I will go back to buying the premium Orville Redenbachers brand at my local grocery. So far Im not impressed with this popcorn. Its tender when popped, but its really annoying how much doesnt pop. Im going to add a little water and then let it sit, closed up, for a while and see if that helps. As of right now, I wouldnt buy this popcorn again. I do like the idea of these crackers for gluten free eating, but I cant bring myself to enjoy them. I bought the 6-pack variety and have tried the Maple Cinnamon and the Onion Garlic. I generally like flax, but these just arent setting well with me even when I use them as a carrier for dips. I feel I wasted my money. Ill probably give the unopened packs to a friends family that are gluten free. I bought a bottle of tapatio hot sauce for my friend to have it shipped over to her in the east coast. The order said itd take 5 business days. It ended up taking over 3 weeks The flavor of Big Train Hazelnut is not significant. One has to add a lot to have a flavor impact. Of the three Big Train flavors I purchased (including Vanilla and Irish Creme), Hazelnut is the least satisfactory. (Vanillas a little better; Irish Creme is best--I gave that one 4 stars). When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they dont seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they dont consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a \"gravy\" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters. The ones I received were mostly yellowish in color with some light green instead of dark green, dry and somewhat stale, they may have been in a warehouse longer that they should have! This is simply a mix of brown sugar and Splenda, I am sure it would be cheaper to make your own I though this product lack flavor as I taste different brands far better.There were no real flavor as I expected. Sorry Had no taste and after the heat of the dish it was on turned them to a leathery tecture. Better off buying the high price truffles. These truffles are not as great as they are made up to be. I thought for the price they would have a greater taste, but they didnt have much taste at all. They are not worth the price, but had to find out for myself. I will not be buying truffles again, and Im not going to spend over $10 for a fresh one. Love the taste of this product, really keeps you full with just a small amount.  First bought it at Costco, they no longer sell this product.  The reason for the two stars, half the bag was crushed, could eat it with a spoon. The product was okay but the color was very different than advertised.  It was a darker pink, not red at all.I tried to use it a couple different ways, and as a relative beginner, I did not find the product easy to use.I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to \"paint\" it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end, because the red color was important for the cake, I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color, not a great deal.In the end, I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was, I didnt find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.  I hope that other people have a better experience as I very much like the idea of the product. Second time I have reported this. One jar broken and orderNot what pictured. Jam same but jar different. I know my gingerThis not same. I have been disappointed with this product.  We have always enjoyed Annies products & have never had a problem, until now.  The \"cheese\" was so solidly clumped that I was unable to make a sauce without lumps.  I have used 3 different packages from my order & have had the problem with all of them.  I am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse.  Either way, beware. I love Annies, but this had no taste, very bland and unappealing. I would not purchase this again, but worst of all Im stuck with 6 boxes...boo! The problem with this peanut butter is the use of \"evaporated cane juice\" which is a coy way of saying \"raw sugar\". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasnt very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the \"cane juice\" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes. I ordered this plant for my seven year old daughter.  She was extremely excited to get it so I even ordered the express 1 day shipping, which I paid over ten dollars for, and it still took over a week to reach my house.  Once it got to my house, I opened the box expecting it to be a fully established plant, which would look similar to the picture shown.  This is not the case.  It came as a pot, a bag of soil, and a damp paper towel with a VERY small plant inside...maybe 1 inch long.  There were absolutely no care or planting instructions or anything like that at all.  We were pretty disappointed.  However, I was able to plant what was there in the dirt and it seems to have survived and looks a bit better now.  My daughter is happy with this plant now, but it was a rough start. I received the pant faster than expected, but it was brown and considerably smaller than advertised. I have very little hope that this plant will live out this week, but if it does I will update this review with a higher rating. The last shipment I received, when preparing the milk there were black specks or particles in it. It was in two out of the three containers. I dont even know if it was in the first can i used. This was the first time its happened and Ive been using goats milk for my daughter since December 2011 and she loves it. Plus it didnt constipated her like whole cows milk. Now Im leary about buying another batch as it may contain this stuff again. Too bad this stuff in general ranks high on the inflammation triggering foods.  Im trying to follow a low inflammation diet.  I do love the taste of goats milk.  Its very rich and creamy.  The liquid is better than the powder. Arrived in good condition, looks like well-made cans. Tastes nice, and I would love to use this product, but unfortunately, i got an allergic reaction from it. I ordered two 24 can packs of 11.5 oz. V-8 juice, which were boxed together and filled with inflated plastic to buffer. When i opened the box, although all the flip-tabs appeared to be intact, one can had leaked some of its contents and the juice was all over the other cans and inside the box. I weighed the cans to find out which one/s had leaked and thats how i determined which one to throw away.(the weight of the cans varied, but the variance was consistent, except one can was a few ounces short)  I am hoping it was just from the one can and i dont turn up with salmonella down the road. Since this was a UPS delivery, i am kind of surprised that amount of pressure was put on this package. Usually get superior service from them. I have ordered like this in the past, and the product arrived in perfect condition, so as i said, i was disappointed this time. I bought this mainly because another review (cant remember if it was on Amazon or another site) said it was better than Morningstar Farms crumbles and because it is GMO free. Now, Ive been a vegetarian since I was thirteen (and that was decades ago), but I am the sort that DOES want fake meat resembling meat. Ive little interest in a mushroom-quinoa burger; I want a meaty-yet-vegetarian burger with mushroom quinoa on the side. Also, Im a professional chef, so Im very picky about the foods I eat.Im saying this because I think it is important to know what the reviewer likes to eat when you base your purchase on a review.Tonight, I used the Harmony Valley hamburger mix in lasagna alla bolognese. I also did the same recipe with the MF crumbles to compare. Two things I was curious about:1) flavor: theyre *kind of* about the same, especially considering I was adding a browned mirepoix, marmite, and veg Worcestershire ... I guess I should fry up a patty of just the HV mix, but I did eat a raw spoonful and it was okay, but blander than MF2) texture: MF wins. It just does (sorry, MF haters). It has larger pieces with a more meat-like texture. Plus, even after absorbing water in the fridge and then simmering on the stove, the HV was too wet.Now, the reviewer who also liked it better than MF also said something about it holding together on its own and that MF doesnt. Well, thats true. This was thick and stuck to itself, much more like the texture of ground meat - if you were to puree it. I use MF often in meatballs, and it holds together when bound with eggs and cheese. I guess thats the difference; I dont just want to thaw or add water and *poof* have dinner. I expect to cook with an ingredient, the same as I would with real beef.So I wasnt bowled over in those ways, but I liked it. HV hamburger mix is good and Im sure it will be useful, which is also a plus - no worry about not having bought a bag of frozen crumbles, youve got a half dozen packets at home. I have a tiny little freezer for someone who cooks for a living, so it is always an issue for me to be able to keep ingredients at home. And although Ive seen some reviews complaining about the 15-20 wait for the HV mix to absorb water in the fridge ... really? Those people cant wait half an hour for a burger? If you want an instant veggie burger that can be microwaved in the time it takes you to grab the ketchup, buy a frozen burger. I think this mix will be good in better handmade veggie burgers and I look forward to trying!Addendum:After eating the lasagna made with the HV mix, both my husband and I experienced horrible stomach bloating and pain. Im apparently a glutton for punishment, though, because I decided to give it another try and made meatballs with it yesterday. Not only did they not turn out as good as my usual ones (made with MF crumbles and Lightlife sausage), they had a sort of rubbery texture that I really did not care for. But, blander and texture I can overlook, except AGAIN, the product gave us both the same horrible stomach bloating pains and gas. Ugh! I tried many teas and thought would try this kind. Saw it on Dr. OZ show. Didnt like its taste. I didnt order because it doesnt indicate anywhere what size the bottle is, I think thats basic information, maybe you should include that in your description This soup is just offensive.  Why does it taste like cinnamon?  Also, its twice the price of Campbells and 1/4 the chicken.  Sure, it says its organic.  I totally believe that, dont you? Purchased two liters... looking for an oil to put in salads, on bread, etc... something with a strong flavor of olive oil... this is NOT it.  This is good for cooking... has little flavor. The tree is nice, but that is the only part besides the pot.  Did NOT come with a matching drip tray, as promised.  Instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper. Well I have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible. Its GOOD for YOU but I just couldnt do it. It might be a good protein shake but its extremely salty, i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse =( too bad because I was looking forwards to see some results!! So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isnt as good, and it doesnt mix that easy. I dont think it is horrible, just not that good.One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didnt reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isnt bad. I have to say that I dont like the dudes picture on the bottle, but thats my only complaint. Pan Ducale Almond Biscotti were a  disappointment to me, not because they were bad, but because they could not come close to the great Lettieri Prato Belli Cantuccini Almond Cookies.  At best they are low in calories - also in almonds. I thought Id be writing a review raving about this product.  Sadly, Im not.I would never use it for home use.  It tasted \"muddy\" and bitter. I followed the directions. I even made sure the water was hot but not boiling. Id probably take it backbacking, but thats it. Its worth a try if you havent tasted it yet. Read some of the other neutral reviews.  It might help with expectations. My 9 1/2 month old would mush this around in her mouth and not swallow it.  There isnt much she doesnt like but she sure doesnt like this stuff.  It looks like a weird mushy green stuff.  I am sure it is super healthy but she didnt like it at all. The grains make this food really flakey. It just doesnt stick together and was falling off the spoon. A major mess really. It also doesnt have a zip lock top and I thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner. I ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie. My baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater. Even my dogs turned their nose up at it and I thought it tasted pretty nasty. My dog demolished her busy bone in under 5 minutes. I think she basically ate it, which was a huge disappointment. We were hoping for something that we could give her that she would ENJOY, but also something that would last a bit longer. In addition to being more of a treat than a chew, these things are messy. She had it all over the floor around her,and all over her paws. It makes a sticky...goop that isnt very easy to clean up. I definitely wont buy these again, its too expensive to only last 5 minutes. Overpriced beans, they are packed in a glass tube that is not air tight.The beans were thin and almost dry.Get the cheaper options at amazon instead, they are much better and way cheaper... I would we willing to try this product, and have six envelopes in my cupboard, but unfortunately the instructions are in German.  Maybe I can hire an interpreter?? Arm & Hammers baking soda is aluminum free, they just dont write it on their packaging.I wasnt sure so I called them and they said there is no aluminum in it, and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally.  This leads me to believe that there just isnt aluminum in baking soda.  And researching it showed me that there might have been in the past, but not anymore and not for a long time.I resent that Bobs Red Mill writes \"Aluminum Free\" on their package and then charges a premium for their product.  Its also arsenic free, I hope.  If they label it \"Arsenic Free\" will we assume other brands arent?  I dont like that kind of marketing. My reason for the low rating is that there was no \"use by\" date on the bag, making it difficult to know if the beans were old and not well cared for or if thats just the way Tanzanian peaberry beans roast up.  Not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products, but this supplier has found some way to get around it.  The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  Ive enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  Ive also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste. So, to find peaberry coffee from Tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up.  I expect to finish up the coffee Ive purchased, but probably wouldnt buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since I have no assurance of its freshness. I tried this pricey dog food for my Australian shepherd on the advice of a friend who has a  small dog does that does very well on one of their foods geared for toy dogs.  First of all, making a decision on what food to buy is confusing.  They have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting.  With the help of a sales clerk I picked the Medium Breed adult. My dog, at first did like the food very much but I felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food I had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it.  The ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils.  Certainly this was not worth the price tag. Regular Reduced fat milk from Horizon received slightly over a month away from the expiration date. My intention was to buy Whole milk but the product description is confusing. I sent an email to the customer support - no response, after 3 weeks I checked and found that they made the picture larger (good) but left the product description without change.As for me, it is crazy expensive shipping while I can get same Fat free or Reduced fat milk at StopNShop or Market Basket. The difficult thing is to find whole milk. Funny that Whole milk as natural product became unpopular. I guess too many people are concerned about becoming overweight:) Wow, very weird taste.  I typically like all the ingredients, but this mix just tastes wrong.  Its somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea, but with a licorice aftertaste.  It isnt so bad that I couldnt finish the first cup, but not my cup of tea. I felt really good about being a good cat mommy and buying something of such quality for my sweeties... Too bad none of the would eat it, no matter what I did.Donated it to the local SPCA -- maybe a dog will eat it. This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chefs reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and its 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee. I wanted to like this coffee, I did. Weve tried other Wolfgang Puck K-Cups and have been pleasantly surprised. This just did not impress us. Bitter aftertaste, and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor. Smells great while brewing, but just does not live up to it in the cup. Im really disappointed because I now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink! Great price though. Warning: this is a STRONG flavor.I thought that this would be Blue Mountain-y... oh no. It is like... rum flavored or something. Yuk. I drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee every morning - Im always looking for a new flavor - so I gave it a try - I drank it but I would not order again. steve First of all, I have owned a Keurig for about 4 years now, and Ive tried lots of coffee.  During that time, I have had an occasion k cup that didnt function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds.I probably should have returned these before I bothered to open the second box.  Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and Ive started straining it after I brew it.I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothys or Tullys that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste, but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $s on a product with a manufacturing defect. Im not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  Theres no aroma when its brewing in the Keurig.  Never again. I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgangs name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothys brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others. The coffee is good. However, at least half of these havent been sealed correctly. When I brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere. Not fun to clean. It may have just been the batch we got, but I wont be ordering these again. Honestly the first time I tried Jamaica me crazy I had to double check to make sure that I didnt leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker. Weak coffee, flavor didnt appeal to me either. Might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side. Wolfgangs vienna roast was pleasant though. Love the flavor, but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were misshapen/melted, as if theyd been exposed to heat during filling.  My husband used two of the ones that were not affected, so Im not returning them, but certainly wish quality control had caught this.  The affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the Keurig. love the wolfgang puck restaurants,cookware,brand endorsed products, all his brand products / cuisine are amazing, i am a loyal fan, yet this creme caramel coffee is tasteless, no real coffee flavor, no hint of caramel or creme, it brews like a bit of steamed milk, that somewhat pasty tasteless feel on your palate. soooo dissapointed as i am such a loyal fan of all his brand, products. sadly,a waste of funds, did not return because i think food items are none refundable. One reviewer mentioned that this coffee was decaff and said it was listed as such on the bottom of the box (in small print). I checked my current box and saw no such labeling information. HOWEVER, the new boxes I received are a different color, with a slapped on label for Hawaiian Hazelnut and NOW the bottom of the box says its made from 100% decaff coffee. While I like the flavor, I do NOT want decaff in the morning, which is when I drink coffee.Unfortunately, I am unable to return this item to Amazon because of their return policy, which is why Im writing this review, to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now. I would give more stars for flavor, but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if I tossed my money out the window, buying something I would not have otherwise ordered. If you like to taste the \"flavor\" in your flavored coffee, skip this one. Ive struggled to taste the creme caramel flavoring that is supposed to be in here. The coffee flavor is also slightly bitter, but that could just be my taste buds longing for some flavoring! Id recommend Green Mountain, Gloria Jeans or Van Houtte brands before this one. Vanilla flavor is barely noticeable.  Acidic taste, not at all what I expected.  Breakfast in Bed and Hawaiian Hazelnut are much better choices. While good quality, it was not at all what I expected. It smelled like caramel and vanilla, but it tasted like straight black coffee. I was pretty disappointed. I was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is.  It has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak. I personally did not care for the coffee, too mild for me and a little \"nutty\" flavor in it.  I will stick with Tullys Kona and House blends, also Emerils Big Easy bold. ...or the good reviewers taste buds are weak.  This is some disappointinglyweak coffee.  Im not some crazy \"gotta have my jet black sludge to getthrough the day\" coffee drinker - Id say my favorite (and my wifes) isCaribou Blend.  This blend is WEAK, it cant hold half-and-half or evenjust whole milk without being wiped out.  Now, I will say I brew it onthe \"large cup\" (9.25 oz, I believe) setting on our Keurig, so maybe itsa bit better on the 8oz setting, or even the small setting.  But Caribou (wealso like Donut Shop, Green Mountain Kona Blend 10%, etc.) can be easilybrewed on 9.25 and hold a good bold taste.  This coffee doesnthold a CANDLE to any of those.  Now Im stuck with 40+ of these. Blech...maybethe guests wont mind it! :) I love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other K-cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which wastes the value of the coffee as drinkable.  Wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging.  I will not order again because of the waste. 10 years ago my daughter brought home Creme Brulee for the first time. It was perfect, beans to be ground.  Since then I have searched for ANYTHING similar. When I realized I couldnt find it, she had forgotten what one she purchased.This one has a strong flavor, but it tastes fake with a strong after taste. Unfortunately it is one of the better ones.  If anyone reads this and knows what ones (Carmel and Vanilla), taste great, please post here. I REALLY like the taste of this coffee! My only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee. Not a huge fan of that and even though I really like the taste of it I will not order again, bummer!! =( I got this is a low cost alternative to my normal Jet Fuel and it just didnt measure up. I like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that I just didnt care for. Also, 3 of the cups had some sort of malfunction and dumped their grinds into my cup-not sure why. This coffee is not a true medium roast like Caribou French Roast, Donut House, etc. there was not much coffee flavor at all. I found it to be so weak in flavor that not only did I have to go down a brew size, but I also have to add less milk just too drink it. I will never buy it again. Wish I didnt have 45 more cups to go thru! I ordered Wolf Gang Pucks k cups, largely because of his reputation and my experiences at his restaurants, both of which are good. However, when I drank my first cup of the Breakfast Blend, I tasted no coffee...it was as if I was drinking hot water. I was very disappointed and will purchase only those k cups which I know to be good. Sorry Wolf Gang, this is a sleeper! My favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like French, Italian, and Full City.  This K-cup dark roast has a big, bold flavor, but lacks balance.  The level of smokiness, bitterness, and acid are way too high, and the result is not enjoyable.  I liked the dark roasts. for the Keurig from Green Mt, Newman, and Donut Shop much more than this one. I love Wolfgang Puck products but the coffee is very disappointing.There is a weak flavor - almost tastes diluted!Some troll must have changed out all the real Puck products!Libbie It seems the flavor selection on Amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut, french vanilla or chocolate so when I saw this one, I thought Id give it a try.  Never having had Wolfgang Pucks k-cups, I was hoping theyd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee Ive had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken. I wouldnt say its the worst Ive had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like Im drinking coffee thats been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and Im getting leftovers.If youre looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesnt really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.  If youre looking for better, richer flavors, stick with Green Mountain which sadly Amazon doesnt seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge $60 for a box! I thought it had a bitter orange flavor, however my husband and friend liked it. The aroma is pleasant, and flavor is nice and smooth, but it is very, very weak.  I really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save, but I just cannot recommend it.  Even making smaller cups it is very weak.  Im going to stick to Newmans Own Organics Extra Bold as my go to k-cup for now. I admit, I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees. But, this one is not for us. We both love the Rodeo Drive. I have a good freind that loves this coffee. I sent her ours. I got this through a Decaf Keurig assortment pack (also from amazon) and while I have enjoyed all of the flavors - thisone was so weak - I had to post a review. Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by \"that other chain\" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didnt seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribus....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they dont put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chefs Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener dont correct for this, and thus Im a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chefs Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I dont believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Cant say the same for some other K-cup brands. This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee. No thanks.  Kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard.  Organic Bold and Donut Shop are still our faves. Wolfgang Pucks \"Breakfast in Bed\" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one. As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As \"flavored\" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable. Very difficult to work with - tends to turn to solid rock even when following directions - taste is less than desirable I am not happy about writing this review. I had very high expectations from both the name and the high praise given by the other reviewers. I was at once concerned, however, based on the weak aroma at first opening. And, these initial concerns were confirmed at first use... little flavor here. I have found a home recipe based off of the ingredient list with stuff from my spice rack produces a much better result.Beef Rub: Brown sugar, sea salt, paprika, chille, rosemary, fresh garlic, chipotle powder, cumin, and McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning.Chicken Rub: Brown sugar, paprika, sea salt, chille, McCormick Montreal Chicken Seasoning, curry, garlic, cinnamon, and Chinese Five Spices. I usually order Bustelo Decaffeinated coffee and I am used to the taste being the same as regular espresso. I tried this Lavazza decaf espresso and I am extremely disappointed. Its really obvious when you taste it that it is decaffeinated and tastes like it is processed. I ordered the 4-pack and would really like to send back the three that I havent opened yet if I can do that... t may be expresso grind, but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker: think again. Bitter when drunk on own. Marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino. I shoulda known betta! I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise.  The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasnt what I was hoping for with my burning throat.  I think a better blend would be something with more \"heat\" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogis Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didnt do that. In general I like Walkers products. I tried to avoid ordering cookies this year and try the oatcakes. They arent very good. The flavor is very mild wheat (maybe like a triscuit?), but the texture is off-putting. They are chewy and make me think of eating cardboard. I tried them with soup, with cheese, and with peanut butter. They were tolerable with peanut butter. Maybe someone else has discovered a better way to eat them? I ordered this for my birthday. I got birthday money from family, and I ordered a couple of goodies, perfume, and this cocoa.  I love hot chocolate, and Im always looking for new ones to try.  Based on the first review I decided to go ahead and order.  I will probably not reorder.  Mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness.  It also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste.  I like Hersheys Bliss Raspberry Chocolate much better.  Ive been adding one spoonful of the Cobblestone Kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost.  But, by itself, it does not stand up to the test. I plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa. My first time having Curry Rice.But boy, I cooked this stuff exactly how youre supposed to.Taste...wasnt bad, I guess, a little \"Strong\" though.IT was thick, like ice slush...it was over-bearing and the spice was pretty intense.I dont think Ill get it again...I guess its good stuff, seen it in some curry making videos...used often, but...not for me, as it it is way to thick.I had potatoes, onions, and pork prepared to perfection mixed with it...and I could not taste them, at all. I could not taste the pork, or anything. Only the Sauce. We tried this formula because it is lactose free, my baby does not have any other issues, just lactose intolerant.We found that it smells bad, does not mix well into water and my baby would not drink a drop. My chihuahuas like this treat, but they do not eat it with enthusiasm. They hesitate and let it sit quite often. This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P.

Wolfgang Pucks \"Breakfast in Bed\" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one. As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As \"flavored\" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable. These pods are rather bland. I purchased them because I thought they would make a nice dessert coffee. They do not taste much different than regular coffee pods. I would not purchase them again, nor do I recommend them. Although it sounded delicious, I was very disappointed in this coffee. The coffee has a strange, chemical aftertaste ... cup after cup, not just once.  Even when it brews, it creates a chemical sort of aroma.  In fact, because our single-serve pod coffee brewer was new, I started thinking the problem was the brewer.  We assumed it was a left-over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water.  I even e-mailed the coffee machine maker (Bunn) to see how to remove the aftertaste.  Imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods (regular Colombian, not flavored) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee.  When we made a cup of the Senseo Vanilla again -- back came the off-taste and aroma.  Perhaps its the \"artificial flavors\" used?  Be forewarned! We have been purchasing this product for several months and have enjoyed it in the past, but this order is inferior.  Did the company change hands or outsource their production? This jam has little fruit taste. If you love damson jam this is not the one for you. It could have been any flavor. All you taste is sweetness. If you are looking for a sugar high, then these are what you are looking for. Too sweet for me and my family, I dont think we will be ordering these again. -- If you buy this from Amazon, youll be disappointed at the shipping.  My box of 12 came in one cardboard box, with the 12 container-boxes loosely in a plastic bag.  One was smashed, so leaking into the bag, two were dented, and one was coming open from the bottom due to the puddle of leaking water in the bag. I opened the bag, and it smelled awful from the rancid, leaking water. If Amazon wants to continue selling the 12-pack-33oz, it needs to package the shipping better. [NOTE, however, I was able to Live-Chat with Amazon and get a refund, even though the item is a \"non-returnable grocery item\".]-- AND, review of the drink:  The drink itself is SUPERIOR to the taste of Vita-Coca(\"good\") or Zico(too sweet), so as a drink, the O.N.E, really IS like drinking from a real coconut out in the tropics.  I am going back to the individual single-serve containers of O.N.E., shipped from Amazon.-- AND, In a second comparison, the multi-pack of Vita-Coca-33oz comes SUPERBLY packaged in the shipping box from Amazon (as EACH 33oz container is invidually protected in a cardboard sleeve).-- Hope that helps (and, Thank you Amazon for letting me have a refund on the damaged box, but it will be more helpful if you can protect the boxes better for shipping it to us). This fondant tastes good but does not work well for decorating cupcakes. Its very soft and the more you mix in color, the softer it becomes. I added powdered sugar to help make it not stick to my mat, cookie cutters and tools, but it was a constant battle. My major complaint with this fondant is that it doesnt harden. I made decorations 3 days in advance (which Ive done in the past using Wilton fondant) and they werent drying. The morning I needed them, they were so soft that even picking them up distorted the shape. I ended up having to place a high powered fan in front of them while I went to work for 8 hours, only to come home to semi-dry decorations. Because I have a ton left over, Im going to try and mix gum paste with it to see if that helps with the stickiness and drying time. I do not recommend this product if youre trying to create flowers, stars or any type of decoration that requires tools and drying time. Needless to say, I will not be buying this product again. After taking a tab, I was able to eat a hot pepper, but it didnt really taste sweet or good at all, just not very hot.  Then I tried some cayenne pepper, which remained hot with no alteration in taste.This is a nice idea, but didnt work for me. Im jealous of whoever thought of this, but the actual product turns out to be pretty unimpressive. It turns out, if you eat half a fruit roll-up, then eat asparagus, the aspragus tastes differently than you might expect.  There. Thats all you need to know.  DONT buy this product, just buy some Gushers next time youre at Wal-Mart.  2 star review because I like Gushers. Maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone. It had very little effect when I used it. I started with a clear pallet, let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc. Then I tried the classic first, a lime. I noticed, barely, that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly. And it did not add any \"sweet\". It just inhibited a hint of sour. Other foods like vinegar, vinegar chips, Guinness, strawberries, cheese, etc. Many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact. And after just a few minutes, I could notice any change.So, either, some people just dont have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility. Either way, they were a let down. Ive tried this with multiple foods, at different times, and with anywhere between one and three tablets, all held on different areas of the tongue. While I could swear there were minor changes at low quantities, this didnt change no matter how many were tried. Im sure that the Miracle Berries are authentic, but my friend and I didnt experience anything as incredible as people say, or even anything noteworthy. I would go for the actual fruit next time. I tried the Frooties mBerry and the effect lasted one hour for me. I purchased this version since it had excellent reviews and was a slightly higher price.This version lasted only ten minutes. I tried tablets out of three different packages from three different batches to make sure it was not a faulty batch. The results from each test was the same.I would not suggest this version of the product, other tablet versions may be more effective but would suggest actual berries. Quite disappointed. The pills dont last that long (it wears off after a few tries per pill) and not all the food items on the suggested list works. E.g. Cheese. Maybe it was a bad batch, but Im not taking the risk to purchase it again. Worked very little. Sweetened fresh pineapple but changed the taste to a bit bitter.A sour orange it did help. It didnt work on anything else at all. First of all, these things taste pretty bad. If you can handle the taste while they melt on your tongue, maybe it wouldnt be AS bad. But I really didnt notice much change in the taste of foods. Lemons tasted sweet, but thats all I noticed. I considered trying two at a time, but they just tasted so bad to me that I have never used them again. After reading the reviews on Amazon and researching food ideas online I got some friends together and we all divulged.  Out of the seven of us who took it, three of us just felt sick after the process.  All of us concluded that while our taste buds were playing tricks on us, they were not necessarily good tricks.  I wouldnt say sour things tasted sweet for instance, I would say they tasted weird kind of like lychees but not very good ones.  The only thing I tried that really improved after dissolving the pill on my tongue was a Coors light.  It tasted like a pretty good Pilsner after the pill, and everyone seemed to like this, but sometimes a nice cold Coors light is just what you need, so...  If you have nothing left to spend your money on, this isnt the worst choice in the world, but dont expect a miracle, because that is not going to happen.  Expect a stomach ache, a loss of appetite, and then you wont find disappointment. StumbleUpon users, be wary. I was browsing when I stumbled upon an article about miracle berries- a cool new fad that apparently causes things to taste different than they normally would. Naturally, I tried to see where I could get my hands on some.Once I found the mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets, I did some research. I always look at a lot of reviews and alternatives before buying anything on Amazon. The price was relatively cheap, I figured, if it worked as advertised. The aggressive claims on the products page and the Amazon user reviews also furthered my need to investigate this mystery product, so I bought two packs- one for me and one for my friend.After both of us trying the Miracle Berry tablets, Id have to say that the product is extremely overhyped, and the experience was, unfortunately, lacking.The way mberry talks about their tablets, youd expect to have a Willy Wonka-esque food tasting bonanza. Sadly, this isnt the case, and though the tablets do change the flavors of many foods to a degree, its much more subtle than youd probably like- no Snozzberries here. I found this to be the case for me, and I was hoping maybe my taste buds were maybe just a bit more dull, but my friend reported the same experience.Im giving the product 2 stars, not because I hated the product, but because I was very let down with the experience and taking that fact into consideration, I dont think its worth the money. Not worth the cost.I have only had these as free samples.I would pay $5 for a pack of 10. I may even be willing to pay $10.00 for a pack of 10.Anything more than $10 is total robbery.So, obviously, $17.99 is WAY too much.This product is SUPER cool, and I LOVED how it worked.But, really? $18.00?Mberry should Market their product as a food enhancer, not as a \"Flavor tripping experience\".If Mberry does that, and prices their products reasonably, it WILL gain customers.Keeping there product around as a \"Flavor tripping experience\" will surely make it a passing fad. My girlfriend loves grapefruit, but I absolutely hate the stuff.  For her, it starts and ends very sweet, for me (and most people in the world) it starts sweet and ends bitter.  After we tried the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXYA5Q\">Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets</a>tablet, there was a small difference for both of us.  For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning.  For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the \"sweetest\" ones shed ever had.However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes.  Both of which tasted noticeably better.  However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes.  To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, youre paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping).Would I try it again?  After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not.  I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).If youre dead-set on trying these tablets, try it with some of your friends, but dont expect too much. Im a huge Stephens fan but Id only ever had the regular Milk Choc hot cocoa.  Deciding to be a little more health conscious I thought Id try the fat-free variety.  DONT! :)  Okay, if you arent expecting it to be like the regular version then go for it.  Its much better than other fat-free hot cocoa varieties but doesnt do justice to regular Stephens Hot Cocoa.  Im going back to the good stuff. I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake. This is half a step above Swiss Miss. It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. Thats more like it.Stephens chocolate has bad/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesnt dissolve. A very disappointing purchase. Unfortunately I didnt notice this until I received the product.  I guess Ill be giving it away to friends & family that dont mind it.Tastes artificial like coffee creamer.IngredientsSugar, Sweet Whey, Maltodextrin, Partially Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Cocoa (Processed With Alkali), Corn Syrup Solids, Non-fat Dry Milk, Natural & Artificial Flavor, Sodium Caseinate (A Milk Derivative), Salt, Mono and Diglycerides, Dipotassium Phosphate, Carrageenan, Soy Lecithin. Ended up with a case of the Stephens chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephens French Vanilla\"cocoa.\"  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believewhat you read, right?I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed justwatery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.It kind of makes me think of baby formula...........the other reviewer who said like a hot vanillamilkshake is close to describing it but it is not creamy enough in my opinion to qualify as such.....I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together andclumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale forthe same amount of servings?Granted, Amazons price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping throughhere and shipping is at a premium through Stephens Gourmet.I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you dont like it.sighgive it away~ Price was misleading, once the high shipping rate was added, the tea was no longer the deal it was promoted to be. Although once it finally arrived, it was half decent tea, but NOT worth the shipping and the wait, will go to my local tea house next time. Love the cinnamon taste but way too sweet. I gave this to my Mother who loves sweets and she said she couldnt eat it either. Need to promote the cinnamin dlavor and cut the sugar Only one store in my area, Sprouts, sells wheatgrass in their produce section. Whole Foods sells it, but it is a goodly distance from my house so I only get wheatgrass from them once in a great while. I have a bunny who enjoys wheatgrass as a treat, so I go to Sprouts to get it for her, but wanted to grow my own since it is expensive and requires frequent shopping trips. So I bought these kits and decided to grow it myself. First I have to say I was impressed at how quickly they shipped my order. So I planted the seeds on Friday and by Sunday night, I had wheatgrass sprouts like crazy. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and deliver abundant grass as promised.I have to say, though, that the grass doesnt look at all like the wheatgrass in stores. The blades are way taller (8 inches) and about twice the thickness of the wheatgrass I am used to buying for my bunny. I took pictures but discovered that my cameras memory card doesnt fit this new computer, so I cant show prospective buyers a picture of it. Rats. Since bunnies have sensitive digestive systems and you have to be careful what you feed them, I dont feel safe feeding this grass to her. I cant return it because I aready cracked open the kit and grew grass from one of the three seed kits. The grass is probably fne, but as a bunny owner, I want other bunny owners to know that this grass isnt like the wheatgrass in stores, jut so they arent surprised and disappointed like I was. I was very disappointed with the quality of the chocolate.If you want the BEST, Ive found that Ethel M.s chocolate liquor barrels are incredibly good - but you WILL pay the price! I love liquor-filled chocolates.  I received these as a gift and found the gel-like liquor not to be very strong.  It was almost as if the liquor had been cut with sweet syrup and all the alcohol cooked out. A young child wouldnt even get a buzz from these.  The chocolate itself was OK -- better than Hersheys and Nestle but not as good as Godiva or Lindt. You know how the chocolate turns light brown when it gets old? Thats how these were at the top. They were that lighter shade of brown as if they were old. That part just didnt taste right, but the liquor inside was good. These candies werent fresh. This was the first time I tried purchasing a food product over the internet, and as feared I was sent something other than what was pictured.This package contains Chia Seed POWDER, which I assume is ground up seed (or the remainder from packaging whole seeds) that you have no way of identifying whether or not has additional filler.Not going to bother returning a $7 product, but just disappointed when the page advertises whole seeds. I was surprised by the number of 5 star reviews of this product. Its a tiny gritty seed that gets stuck in every corner of your mouth and the taste is like nothing. Kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste. I finally ask myself why am I eating this annoying seed and put it out back in the bird feeder unfortunately they dont seem to like it much either. 2.0 out of 5 stars Read this article first, August 11, 2009By  Pregbaby (Florida) - See all my reviewsI thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]From the article:Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity. I have been searching for a natural lemonade drink mix that would actually taste good.  This is not one of them.  Did not like the the bitter taste of this drink mix. I can make my own fresh squeezed lemonade better than this stuff.  In the mean time I purchase Newmans Own ready made lemonade if I dont have the time to make my own lemonade. I ordered and got seeds.  Called, got a refund and reordered... got seeds.  Ill have to order the sprouted chia seed powder elsewhere. :) Ugh, this stuff may be good for me but its not appealing.  I mixed it in my oatmeal for a while, and it was fine that way (but sticky).  But I didnt notice any obvious effect and Ive slacked off. I did not enjoy this soup; I will try a different brand next time. I spent close to $4.00 for each cube which turned out to be the 16oz size.  I know it says that upon further review but I was assuming it was the 3lb size because that size is $3.99 at the grocery.  And I just paid the same thing for the 1lb size?!  Shame on you Amazon.  Or better yet shame on me.  The expiration date is fast approaching too so Im not even sure Ill use these up in a month.  I was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date.  I had the same issue with some sunflower seeds I bought recently, they expired before baseball season even started.  However, I did get what I paid for...its just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what I thought I was getting.  Who would pay that for the 1lb size? I am giving these two stars because they did taste sorta good at first.  But like the other reviewer said they do smell funny and they left a bad taste in my mouth.  And they are very salty.  I only cooked them for 90 seconds, the bag was still expanding when I stopped it but they smelled burnt when they were done (they said to cook until it stopped expanding but thank goodness I didnt do that).  Nice idea but I dont think I will buy these again. I was so excited to receive the product I immediately cooked a bag.  What a disappointment!!  The taste of the pork skins was there but it was buried by some spice that I didnt enjoy.. I couldnt finish the bag!  My dog wouldnt eat them either ans she eats everything - including brusell sprouts!  I have had microwave pork skins that were good but I dont remember the brand so Ill just have to do without But the taste got sickening quite fast. It also makes a really weird stench/smell when you are microwaving it. Sometimes it would hurt my tongue when I am eating it. All in all, I threw the rest of them away after my 3rd bag. It might just be me but I cant say I would let the guests of my home try these so I cant recommend them here to anyone. was really dissappointed in product... too salty and poor flavor....Convenience is what makes product worth purchasing if you like pork rinds... I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.Oh and they arent hot nor spicy. Just salty. Theyre ok I guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it. Youll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent. Also, no matter what you set the timer on the microwave, you will have little burn/hardened pieces. So youre not even getting a whole lot out of one bag. I tried these and wanted to like them, but just couldnt.  They did not seem to \"pop\" very well (a lot of wasted product in the bag) and they didnt taste very good.  I will not be buying these again. Not one member of my family, including me, like these extremely salty, much too strong a BQ taste to order more.  I purchased them on a recuring basis and i wish to cancel now.  I have received only one shipment. Cancel further shipments.  Not to our taste at all. These are Lowery pork rinds. The taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed. Some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all. I bought a box of these so I tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes. All in all I will stick with the ready to go variety offered by Frito Lay and Mission. The Lowreys Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason. So I made one bag of these pork rinds & it came out good! I decided to try another & the taste was unbelievable - it had an ammoniated taste & smell to it! I thought that maybe it was a bad bag. I stayed away for a few weeks & decided to give them another try. BAD IDEA! They tasted like ammonia again! This wasnt caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy, and crispy. I ended up throwing the box out. In all fairness my friend absolutely loves this product.  I purchased it based upon his suggestion.  Unfortunately, the smell (oil I am assuming) of it cooking made me feel ill.  Even though the product cooked perfectly, the smell lingered in my microwave for well over a day. I considered buying these but the health risks should be considered.These are cured, stored with salt, and have nitrates.If you look on the american cancer society web site you will see that those are cancer causing concerns.you can still eat well when avoiding such things. This was my second purchase of this product. The first purchase was great, but this 2nd must have been a defective batch. Most packs did not cook correctly because they were not sealed tight and opened during cooking. That caused them to burn or not cook completely. I did not send them back because I kept thinking, maybe the next one will be better, but I was wrong. There are a few packs left, but Im hesitant about microwaving them. I will probably purchase some again, but it will not be anytime soon. Not thrilled with this one - threw most of it away.  For some reason, the result ended up being \"gummy\" which isnt something I expected from this type of product. I am having probs with the cooking. They come out all fluffy and in 20 seconds suck back into themselves and get all hard. Ive tried less time, more time and cooking them out of the bag on a paper towel... Dunno what I am doing wrong, and the company doesnt have any contact info. As for the taste..theyre Alright..Waay salty and Im a salt-a-holic!I wouldnt buy again :( I saw these on the Food Network Channel, and they made it sound so delicious on TV. I only wanted to buy one or two packets to try, but Amazon only sells them in a big box.  Theyre light and crispy if theyre popped correctly, a little on the salty side because of the MSG seasoning (beware migraine sufferers). Not all of the bacon chips pop, and you cant eat the ones that dont because its like plastic before theyre nuked in the micro.  Now, I am stuck with the rest of the box. I expected better. Flavor is o.k. But half of the rinds do not puff up no matter what the timing in the microwave. For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. Ive followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasnt exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb. I think this chunky chili is the worst store-bought chili.  The meat has the texture of artificial soybean meat and is chewy, thesauce is too sweet and cloy.  This has no character.I prefer Hormel or Dennisons to this.  By far. I love Chuckles, so the temptation to buy some in bulk overtook my better judgement recently. I dont know why, but I was surprised to discover that each HUGE (\"Movie Size\" box was mostly air and contained a small clear plastic wrapping with 8-10 pieces of candy in it. I AM old enough to have fallen for this. I ate them all quickly to quell my feelings of having been made an idiot out of yet again by air-filled boxed nothingness. Chuckles is a great and classic candy - But this packaging is quite deliberately deceptive and insulting. I would shop for other packages (at other sites) should the Chuckles-urge overtake me yet again. I was very disapointed with these flowers. Several of the  stargazer buds were damaged, as if they had been frozen, and several others are such that they will not  open very well, although there is still time for them to improve perhaps. But, the number of flowers for the money was wholly inadequate. On the bright side, the Iris are blooming nicely and are beautiful. Based on the condition of the stargazers, and the inadequate number of stems,however,  i do not think I will order from this company again Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands werent available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized Id made a huge mistake.I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Dont get me wrong, it isnt nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I wont eat. Perhaps itll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if youre going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, theres a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon. Pop Secret is by far my favorite popcorn and I eat about 2 bags a day. I normally get the homestyle, but is was always to dry when I ordered on line so I went to the Butter thinking it wouldnt be so dry. No such luck. When I buy from the grocery store it is much more flavorable and fresh and it doesnt cost that much more. I checked the dates and the store vs online bulk was about 6 months different on average which probably causes the difference even though they both are in the sale by date range. with this said, I am going to have to discontinue buying this product online unless something changes and Ill really miss it coming straight to my door since I eat so much. I waited for 3 months of getting this product before posting because any company can have a bad batch of anything. Sorry. I hope this changes in the future!! Ok,lets start of by saying that my microwave is not very good for popcorn,but in my local grocery store I can buy Market Pantry popcorn for $ 4.25 for 18 large bags and not all the pop corn kernels pop but very yummy,and I went through 2 boxes in less than a month,but then we have this one Pop Secret and my first 3 bags BURNT  and was not happy so I decided not to follow the instructions,so I decided to put microwave at 3 minutes and let it stop when it got to 20 secs,ok so it didnt burnt it,but due to me not placing it microwave on high,it took a very long time to cook it,and so anyways it began to pop,and so I thought great,at least no burnt popcorn,and I was so excited and HUNGRY to try it,due to the ratings on this site,I began to eat it,and my first reaction was,oh my good ness,DRY DRY ,where is the butter ?..its called butter pop corn so where is the BUTTER ? did it get all dryed up in microwave ? Gimme better ingredients (KIND/Larabars) for more $ or sweeter items (genuine junk) for less $. Not sure Id invest in a single bar again, let alone this size. I bought these based on another review from the other product, the Nutiva hempseeds 3 pack stating that those hempseeds have crunchy husks in it and these do not.  I also based my purchase on all the great reviews on this product here.  I was expecting just the white hearts of the hempseeds, sort of like when you buy shelled sunflower seeds.  When I opened the package I was severely disappointed.  It was white with black bits all over the place.  Ill upload a picture when I get the chance, it looked like dirt.  I gave it a taste and it felt like small bits of glass crunching in my mouth, it was absolutely repugnant.  Maybe I received a bad batch, who knows?  I am not here to put off other potential buyers, just telling my story on my purchase.  Im going to try another product because I really want to add Hempseeds to my diet. I bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house. It did not help at all. I even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go, well they just dont go anywhere close to it, it really looks like it repels the ants, instead of attracting them. I have not found yet a product that work for my ants, except the spray that kills them instantly (but I cannot spray it in the kitchen, and I have ants all around the counter top, even if it is cleaned to perfection). For the price you pay and size of each cup (you can really only make the smallest size) you are getting taken with this purchase. Buy the traditional mix from any other company, you will get a better value, better taste and a richer texture. This snot a horrible mix, it tastes ok, but it is nothing more than a decent cup of chocolate flavored water. It has no thickness to it. Swiss Miss or any other grocery store hot chocolate beats it hands down.All you are getting with this is convenience of using K-cups, which is not much of one to begin with.Avoid it. It is so watery and weak, I had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate.  This makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly.  Each pod is 60 calories, so a full cup would be 120.  Will not purchase anymore. The hot chocolate has a weird flavor to it.  I will not be buying this product again, and will probably not consider any more green mountain products. I used the minimum cup size to try and maximize the chocolate taste.  This did not help but if you like a weak chocolate taste then you will like it. I dont like this product at all.  Much tastier and cheaper to just use hot water and a packet of hot chocolate mix from Nestle or Swiss Miss. This product would be better made with milk, which of course, then would not be for the Keurig machine. There are other brands I prefer. This hot chocolate is pretty blah. Not very chocolatey and certainly not very strong. Its not the fault of the Keurig -- the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate is way better. Ive been through two 24 cup boxes of this hot chocolate, and it isnt great.  Its not badly priced, and the first few sips are fine.  But after it sits for five minutes cooling in your cup it separates.  It ends up being watery for the most part with a bunch of chocolate mix on the bottom. Of course the Keurig Green Mtn Hot Cocoa is the ultimate in convenience, but, frankly, the flavor is not so hot.  Best description is slightly chocolate-flavored cardboard.  Everything else about it is fine (consistency, ease of use), but G.M. should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate. The hot chocolate is fine but the price here is crazy.  You can get the same thing on the Keurig site for under $15. I was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews. This is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water. I prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better. Adding milk didnt help much. I guess Mom spoiled me (good). Very disappointed in this.  Heed the bad reviews.  I am now at the lowest amount of brewing and it still tastes watered down.  Need to dump some Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate in there to give it flavor and that point, what was the purpose.  With the product already being overpriced (shop elsewhere)as it was and tasting watered down; it just wasnt worth it.  Skip it!  Maybe a different brand will be better. Even though the little ones liked this product, I thought it was bland and not much flavor to it.  I will not buy more of these. I used the small cup setting and even opened up the cap and scraped the excess mix out of the cup and it is still very weak tasting. This is the very worse BBQ suace I have ever tasted and bought. I saw the man v Food  show which featured the stomach bile tasting thin sauce and then bought it ...wow  Texas really doesnt know BBQ sauce. I wanted to give this product a try as the liquid honey crystallized in a few weeks during the winter months. This small 8 oz. packet does clump together a lot more than other sweeteners so there is less of an advantage over using honey in a jar and spooning out the crystallized honey.For the price I consider it a poor value. Taste is OK but nothing to rave about and not as good as with regular unprocessed honey. Give yourself the gift of buying the regular skippy.  Although this gives you less fat, there is a distinct taste difference.  We will eat what we purchased but I am still in disbelief that such a minimial amount of fat reduction in a product really makes a great PB turn into a yuckky PB... I like creamy peanut butter, however this is hard to spread because part of the oils are kept out to make it reduced fat. Kinda makes for a messy sandwich. For the uninitiated, evaporated cane juice is just sugar by another name. Another product that tries to present itself as healthy, but isnt really...eating something that lists sugar as the second ingredient isnt what I would consider to be a healthy start for the day. I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond \"Roasted Almonds - Honey\" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond \"Honey Roasted Almonds\" ( <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW\">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but theyre surprisingly not the same, and have a very \"off\" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and \"other natural flavors\", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.Ive been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond \"Honey Roasted Almonds\" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  Its as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that its not the same product.Id contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not \"slivered\" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.So Im offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned \"Honey Roasted Almonds\" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and Ill be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased. This is basically candy masquerading as a \"healthy\" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - cmon!I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, theres a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now Im stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack. All the 5-star reviews convinced me to buy these...I wish I hadnt :(  Its been two months since I purchased them and I still have four out of the six containers unopened.  Theyre just blah.  Now the chili lime flavored almonds from Blue Diamond, on the other hand, are Mmm Mmm good! The delivery was extremely quick, the packaging was fine, and if you suck off all the honey, the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. Mind you, I could eat 3095826 honey roasted PEANUTS. Ive been drinking loose leaf tea for a while now and this has to be the worst stuff I have tried yet. I believe by \"Fine Tea\" they mean small particle size. My box is about the consistency of a box of dirt, instead of nice leaf parts. Following the directions did not produce a pleasant cup of tea. There is too much bitterness in this tea. I would definitely suggest checking out the Adagio teas. My Mother-in-Law gave me a sampler for Christmas and it had some excellent teas. This product doesnt have the greatest taste. I like Jamba coconut water, but its hard product to find. I purchased this to try out and Im not liking it, but its tolerable when its cold; really cold (reason why I gave it two stars).  I tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough, they were right. I had hoped that this would taste like Pina Coladas but it doesnt.  It is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue.  I wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is good in mixed drinks.  I have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol.  If you are going to drink this straight, it helps if it is really cold....almost frozen.  If you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing I can taste in it, The folks at Starbucks are not exaggerating when they say their French Roast coffee is \"Extra Bold.\"  In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.  The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water.  The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesnt taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee thats been left heating in the pot too long.  The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar.  With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldnt recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week. I would not recommend this oil.  It does not have a pleasant smell and does not purify the skin.  Its just like other oils I have bought from drug stores which were cheaper. I guess Im in the minority, but I really didnt like these much. I was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when I saw it, but these were disappointing. The bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla-ish undertaste. Absolutely NO cheesecake or cream cheese type flavor and even the graham layer is just sweet without any real graham cracker taste. The overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy -- not at all creamy. Sizewise they are smallish, but pretty standard for any of the many 100 calorie-ish snack pack foods. Similar in price as most granola and snack bars, none of which are ever much of a good value. Overall, while they arent inedible or anything, I would not buy these again and I dont even think Ill bother with the rest of the box. The sweet Maui onion tastes like sour cream and onion.  I was hoping to get the delicious chips that I enjoyed in Maui.  Dont wast your time. The kettle chip itself is crisp, crunchy and good, although somewhat greasy.  Over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with Rosemary flavoring.  Leaves greasy, gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips. This lemon salt is ok, but the salt is not infused with the lemon, the lemon is mixed with salt granuals.  So might as well use lemon. I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant.  I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years.  I bought a box of Lucys chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucys cookies remind me of Pamelas cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.  I would suggest either Udis frozen cookies or Glutino cookies.  I find these two brands superior to Lucys.  Thanks for reading. I bought these cookies after reading all the rave reviews but they were very dry, didnt have much chocolate, and left an unpleasant aftertaste. I dont understand what all the fuss is about. If these were the only GF cookies available, I still wouldnt buy them again. These cookies are small, grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste. And very expensive for such a small package of 16 cookies. Might be great for multiple allergies, But I was very disappointed. These are good, though a bit too salty for my taste. But you can get these for about 40% less at any grocery store. Save your money! When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesnt make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it. These arent clearly labeled \"GLUTEN FREE\". They say pretzel sticks and they do not resemble pretzel sticks very closely at all. They are a weird flavor, sort of costly and not worth it. eew. You get 12 bags for 12.00, in each bag is about a handleful of pretzels. The taste is ok but not worth a dollar a bag.. These pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value, but their flavor is very bland.  Bland with a hint of cinnamon.  I wish Id tried a single bag before buying an entire 12-bag box, but theyre not available in stores (at least where I live) and the reviews seemed fairly positive.  On the bright side, they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories.  A recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein-dense snacking rather than flavor. The freshness is great during the initial crunch but once the chewing and swallowing takes place, these pretzels are very earthy and grainey tasting...I have several bags you can have for free. The first couple of bags were great. Really fresh, smooth, great taste. I thought Id found the perfect coffee bean!! The next 5 bags .. stale. I canceled my order and went back to buying whole bean coffee from the supermarket. You pay a little bit more, but Ive found that most of the time, the supermarket coffee is fresher. I prefer the taste of Weavers but too many stale bags. its not that this coffee sucks its that it doesnt begin to measure up to all the hoopla!its well balanced but thats about it& even a little old tasting nothing special in the leastwhat sweet caramel finish?cant believe this is the same coffee the 5 star reviews are about My dogs have been enjoying these treats for years and weve ordered this many times from Amazon in the past.  However, our last order was a big disappointment.  The description of exactly how much of this product you will receive is very unclear, so when I saw that the product weight is 4.2 lbs and the shipping weight is 4.6 lbs., naturally I expected to receive a minimum of three one pound bags (as we have in the past).  Not so.  Amazon outrageously charged us $41.00 for a single one pound bag of dried lamb lungs.  Youd think I was buying caviar!  The treats were promptly packed back up and returned.  Tsk, tsk, tsk, Amazon :(So, 5 stars for the product itself.  0 stars for Amazon this time. I love this sugar.  Ive been using it, packaged in envelopes, for a year or two for everything.  Gives a great homemade taste to cookies.  And packaged in envelopes - see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZK7C\">Sugar in the Raw Raw Sugar, 24-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> - its wonderful stuff.But not in this packaging.  If you dont use the whole 12 pounds right away, the boxes of sugar turn hard as a rock.  Have to microwave them, pound them with a hammer, and then pour the sugar into a plastic envelope with a sugar bear - e.g., <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UKOWFC\">JBK Bear Terra Cotta Brown Sugar Saver</a> - to make it possible to use it.  Definitely not worth it.  Buy it packaged in bags or not at all. These are tasty enough for an emergency snack/lunch--I keep a few in my file cabinet. But our local Meijers sells them for $1.33 apiece. Even the discount price here is twice that. These were fair.  I dont feel they are AA quality.  Would not repurchase. I went for these, when I got a free 30 bucks to spend with a new Amazon Credit Card, and Im glad I didnt pay full price.I was in the process of creating an authentic Bolognese Meat Sauce, and I wanted some very hearty mushrooms to add a bit of OOMPH to the sauce, which is meat and onion heavy, and I figured from the reviews that these are a meaty tasting mushroom.  I also see the price asked for these at our local Giant Eagle grocery stores, so, yeah, I did get a bargain from their rip off pricing, but, these are basically taking up freezer space.I ordered two grades, a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces, less stems, etc, and in retrospect, should have just ordered the scraps, or even the dust, as I found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture, even after hours of cooking, I also extracted just juice from the mushrooms, but the broth wasnt strong enough to bother, I basically just chop these in the food processor, and add a LOT of them to get a change in flavor in recipes, the one ounce bags, dont even bother with, because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them.In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I cant compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe.

Unfortunately, all package size descriptions on the product page are wrong.  These are not 1.25oz packages and they are also not 1oz packages (as stated further down in the description).  They are .08oz packages.  Very disappointed in this fact.  Cherryheads are tasty, though, and the shipping was fast. This pecan meal is more like bran flakes than pecans.  I had thought it was ground pecans, and the name would indicate that.  The container it came in is very light, which was my first clue it was not exactly the whole pecan nut meat.  The \"meal\" is flaky.  The price might have been a clue, I suppose, since the per pound price of pecans is over $12 most places. We purchased the pretzels to make chocolate covered wedding favors for our guests. The pretzels would not have been bad for anything else, but there were way too many broken ones... we would have had to buy five more barrels. My only complaint now is that we shipped them back over a month ago and still havent received our refund! They may have great products, but shipping is incredibly slow (shipped 12 days after I placed the order; not yet received) and the shipping price is unreasonable. DONT BE FOOLED - This is not a Health Cereal.The second ingredient is SUGAR and this cereal also has fructose in it.  I feel like Im eating kid cereal.  It would be healthy if it had less sugar in it.  Carb-conscious people and diabetics BEWARE. When we first bought these we tried to eat one and couldnt.  Looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts.  Taste is awful.  Our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell.  After about a week the contents of the bag start to mold.  Since they are for the dog, we washed them off and then store in the fridge.  Too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc.  Not recommended for people food. Very expensive and not worth the price. Try PurityFarm Organic Ghee, its much cheaper and taste much better than this Ghee. Dont waste your money. Cannot detect any difference from other ghees.  Also, their supposed free sample is not really. They ship a tiny jar in a box through the mail and it costs about $2.00 in postage, something for the box and it costs you $4.99.Very disappointed.  They should reconsider doing that because it taints all of their offerings. Why in the world would Amazon want to sell an item and say can be ingested,  when it clearly has ingredients that can cause cancer. Wish every state would wake up like California and ban all these cancer causing things. It taste okay, but they are  not soft and the taste doesnt stay very long. I wouldnt buy them again. I had a good experience with other Amazon grocery products and these were a good deal, so I bought a three pack. They werent horrible but they dont taste the same as the ones you buy in the store. They taste like cheap generic chocolate chip cookies. Which is not necessarily bad, but not what I expected for the price and Chips Ahoy brand.They are cheaper tasting, a little stale and much less chocolate chips. I havent had store-bought Chips Ahoy for a few months so maybe they changed the formula for all these cookies, but if not, then these seem to be cheap knock-offs made with cheaper ingredients. Product is good; my cats like it.  But the price just keeps climbing.  I will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food. Tuna, as is well documented, absorb and store Mercury in fat.  Anything that eats that fat consumes Mercury. I wouldnt feed tuna to a child, and Id recommend any adult to read the literature regarding mercury content in seafood. How can it be safely fed to a cat? Regarding this brand of cat food, its excellent as long as you feed chicken or turkey. This sells for $29.99 at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Add your 20% off coupon and youre good to go ...I also had cabinet issues and returned it to BB&B. When I received this item, I was very disappointed with it. It is rather cheap looking and I wouldnt want this on my counter for all to see. The left side of the tray was lopsided and looked strange when you pulled it out. Needless to say I boxed it back up and sent it back for a full refund. Definitely not worth $25.00, but after seeing it I would have been equally disappointed had I paid only $10.00. Terrible clunky product.. drawer doesnt open/close without making clunky noises.  Not a space saver, hard on the eyes.  Would return it for a refund if I werent terribly lazy.  Go to Bed Bath and Beyond and use a 20% off coupon for something else.  Not worth it. Ordered 2 both had bent tracks and I actually cut my finger on one of the wires sticking out. But you get what you pay for.... Looks good, but does not open and close smoothly.  The drawer has medal feet that fit into a groove in the bottom of the unit as a track.  The tray sticks a lot and you have to hold the top of the unit to jerk the drawer out. Ive been looking at this holder since I saw it at the at my office. Today I found it at BB&B for $24. It works great but too expensive at Amozon. Honestly, with the amount of sugar in these, they are not much better than eating a 300 calorie regular cookie. I dont think these are that \"healthy.\" The cookies taste fine, but I wont repurchase. I really wanted to like these, but I just found them to be to sweet/sugary.I generally stay away from cliff bars for the same reason, and had hoped that these would be as good as they sound.Sadly its just to sweet tasting for me.Special note: The packs I received Oct 2010 have 20g sugar, not the 17g listed in the Amazon nutrition section.There may have been a recipe change . . . We picked these up based on the glowing reviews. My fault, my mistake. I believe they are WAY over-rated. Doesnt taste morning glory at all. Instead, tastes just like any one of the other in the line ... dry, stale, dense, oatmeal \"cookie,\" like a cookie experiment gone bad by a pre-teen.In addition, cookies arrived cracked, broken and sticking to bag, yet are dry & stale inside. What a waste. I would have never purchased these in a B&M store had I had an opportunity to examine them first. The breakfast cookie is not to my liking and I do not think I will order them in the future! I was disappointed by my first taste of Kopali Organics Chocolate Covered Dried Banana. The chocolate is waxy and the bananas too soft for me. I was expecting more crunch, a drier banana. The banana did not taste of banana to me either. I will not purchase again. It clearly states on the description, pack of 6!  But I only got 5!  And I cannot find how to complain about this.  I dont want to return. Sesmark makes a very high quality rice cracker and then proceeds to ruin it by loading it up with so much salt as to make it inedible.  USE CAUTION before buying this item since there are NO RETURNS and you might find yourself with a throw away. The bamboo arrived about 2 weeks after ordering, all intact and well packed.  However, there were no instructions for caring of the bamboo.  It is now almost a month since arriving and part of the bamboo stalk looks like it is dying and turning brown (part of the heart shape).  I would buy more from this company if the shipping wasnt so costly (for the area where I live the shipping was about $10 and the product itself $15). this is not a review of the product, but the seller/shipper. I ordered this on september 22nd. It is now october 9th and I still have not received the item. The Bonzai I ordered came well before the estimated date...however... the tree I got as a gift was TINY. Nothing like it looks like in the product picture. These sardines are okay, nothing more.  Dont fall for it.  At $2.82 a tin plus shipping, the Bela Sardine from Portugal blows these out of the water.  You can purchase Belas for $2.45 a tin and maybe less if you find them sold in bulk.  What am I going to do with 11 more tins of a so-so sardine.  Ugh! I ordered two of the Hazer Baa Turkish Apple Tea (pack of 2) as pictured so I would save on the shipping and instead received the Green Apple Tea (same brand and price).  It didnt taste like the original but I didnt want the hassle of sending it back and so I will not be ordering it again.  This tea did not have the strength or zing of the original.  Im upset still. I really like eggnog, especially with brandy. While the ones with brandy already in them are very good, I wanted to try this product when eggnog is usually out of season.My experience with adding brandy to real eggnog does not create the same taste as the premixed variety. This product does not improve upon this experience.  Using a milk frother, I poured the mixture into a cup of 2% milk with about an ounce of brandy, and found that I needed about twice as much of the recommended amount of the Aspen mixture to get any eggnog flavor. The mixture will thicken in a few minutes, but the eggnog flavor is mainly sweet to me.However, I must mention that I have no sense of smell, and therefore my experience with this product may have been largely due to my condition. I have fed the chicken and duck version of these--though now the reviews regarding china I find disturbing.Regardless, the beef liver version of these are not a hit with my pup and seem to be a very odd, plastic texture.The duck and chicken are both great--but I will be investigating the source of the food. Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label. The dosage amount of Glucosamine/Chondroitin is vague. It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat theyll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere. My Shih Tzu loved these and I have been giving him these duck treats off and on for the past two years with no obvious problem even though they are made in China. Ordinarily I would not give my dog anything made in China, but I could not find any duck treats made in the USA. Well, recently I purchased a large package of these at a Pets Warehouse store. I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didnt want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.So, I dont know if its just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something. Not going to take any more chances with this brand. My labrador LOVES all the treats from Dogswell ! However, all of the Dogswell Jerky treats I have come across are Made In China. As a dog lover, I cannot knowingly give my dog a product from China. It does say \"cage-free\", but really? Im not sure. BUT DOGSWELL Jerky Bars are Made in the USA & my dog loves this just as much! So bad news on the regular jerky, but upside: Dogswell has some USA products too! I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, its about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) \"U.S.A. Rawhide\" and on the back, in fine print, was \"Made in China.\"  Why arent our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  Its sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our \"furry kids\" that wont make them sick or kill them! I have purchased numerous canned chicken products before, and of course none compare to real chicken.  However, that being said, this products quality is considerably below that of most canned chickens.  Other canned chickens have large chunks of white meat, while this product is full of small discolored pieces with pieces of what appear to be skin or fat.  Considering the price is also higher than the store bought competitors, I can not recommend this product. If you are going to take Noni take pure Noni, not one with juice added, I didnt read that it contained the raspberry juice I wish I had taken Tamdidelams review more seriously before ordering. My family has a vacation home in Tunisia. I always bring some Harissa home with me, either in a glass jar or in a tube. I was excited to find this on Amazon, but it has nothing in common with the original Harissa. Harissa is a pasty substance that is very hot - way hotter than Tabasco or other brands of hot sauce common in the US. Harissa contains seeds of chili peppers. This product is barely spicy at all and the consistency is more like tomato paste. Tomato is listed as the main ingredient, hot pepper (piment) less than 8%. These peanuts are rock hard.  I ate a handful of peanuts and got a bad stomach ache.  They dont taste bad, and not salty at all. I dont understand why they are so hard.  Ouch.  I love the peanuts from Costco.  They are also extra large and delicious but they never hurt my stomach.  Must go back to them. I opened the box with the 3 cans of peanuts and all 3 cans had a large dent on the side. There was no damage to the box so obviously the cans were damaged prior to the packaging. At least the peanuts were OK. Maybe we are being sold \"seconds\" through Amazon by this company. Buyer beware or you may receive peanut butter rather peanuts from this company. I love these - they taste great.  But I get them in the local Dollar Store. Two stars for the value, five for taste. Well, I love hard candies, but not the sugar. My husband & I saw these and thought wed found the perfect solution. Unfortunately, the candies -- while very tasty -- played havoc with our systems. We couldnt eat more than 8 at one time (5 for me) without getting crampy & gaseous. At first we didnt realize it was the candies causing the effect, but that changed quickly. We had to discard the rest of the product. What a shame. I am a fan of Pamelas gluten free products and have been happy with all of them until I got the Raisin Walnut Cookies. I just received the order a couple of days ago. Ive eaten four of the cookies and they are very good tasting. However, in two of the four cookies I found myself chewing what presumably was walnut shells! I could have easily chipped or broken a tooth.Pamelas makes some great products but this one is \"risky\". The title says it.  Some of the cookies arrived with the chocolate melted.  Others were stuck together or had the wafer separated and stuck to the chocolate top of the cookie below.  It appears that the box was a little overheated and banged around somewhere along the way here.  It was 65F here when the package was delivered. I bought these cookies for myself and as a gift for my dad for his birthday. Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad. I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. Theyre very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think Ill stick with the Bahlsen Delobas. The bag we received from Amazon had hollow biscuits and were harder than the ones we purchased from a local store.  Were these a reject batch?  Certainly over baked or dried out!  Our bichon had a hard time biting into it. It appears Amazon may have gotten a bad batch, or they are very old.  I was excited to find these as my Husky-Shepard has allergies to Beef & Chicken and these did not contain either.  They are expensive, but I decided to try them.  When I opened them they have all sorts of holes (looks like air holes) in them and the dog (66#) had a hard time chewing through them.  I think she liked the flavor, but biscuits shouldnt be so difficult to eat. I saw several other people with the same comments, so I believe either Amazon or the manufacturer needs to figure out what is happening with these.  Had they been $1.00 a bag I would figure I got what I paid for. The last bag of these I got from Amazon had a lot of hollow bisquits.  It was weird ......  they just werent solid like they should be.  Im going to switch to another brand of grain-free dog bisquits now as theres no sense in paying for something Im not getting (and these are expensive!)  And if it wasnt for the good packaging Id wonder if bugs had gotten to them..... but I dont think thats possible. Just be aware.....the first ingredient on the list is salt.  I dont find this product very peppery, hot or spicy.  It is a disappointment. This item, though a cute idea, really doesnt live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The \"hot chocolate\" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasnt fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly cant even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.If youre looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls. However, if youre expecting something akin to hot cocoa as it is generally understood to be, I would look elsewhere. This is a very pretty container, and my granddaughter loved the blue color when mixed with water-- but--- it tastes more like coconut than chocolate-- should be labeled hot coconut drink. This is one of my favorite cereals. But purchase it only if you dont mind eating it in powder form. What you get is mostly powder, not crunchy squares. I will not be ordering again, sorry. While taste is OK its simply using too many artificial colors (blue1, red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6 - approved by FDA doesnt mean its healthy) and other chemicals (BHT etc) to be used by children.If youre going to eat it yourself - take your chances. But since there are many good and healthy alternatives - why bother? This is an okay gift box, only if you like mediocre cheese and summer sausage. The items are small, smaller than they appear in the picture. I only paid $30, but I would not purchase it again. On the positive side, the mustard samples that come with it make the items edible. Thank god that i tasted the metal before i swallowed them. I dont even get how it got mixed up with this. The candy itself is sex in mouth. I bought these (plainer box) at a Whole Foods. Definitely not worth the $4.29 I paid for them. Theyre so... bland. Like someone lightly and I mean lightly sprinkled bits of cinnamon and dried apples over cardboard. There are no vitamins added either. So theres little health value. They couldve at least put some vitamins in there to make eating flavored cardboard worth it. Ill probably just eat this box as a snack alternative to potato chips. I cant afford to just toss them. Will NOT be buying them again. I bought this cereal for my kids (ages 6 and 7) who cant eat gluten any more.  They wont eat it.  I think it passes to at least finish the box but my kids would be happy to throw it out. OK, I cant stand these things, but my babies love them, so I gave it 2 stars, not one. First of all, its just puffed corn, like Peanut Puffs, if youve had those by Envirokids. And that wouldnt be so bad if they didnt taste like you were licking a cinnamon stick or putting a teaspoon of ground spice in  your mouth. For being \"all natural\" it sure does pack an unpleasant wallop! Watch out! Maybe the Honey Nut is better... I liked just about all the Capri Suns up until a few years ago. For some odd reason (possibly because tons of people in the U.S. have a mild to severe problem with being overweight) they decided it was a good idea to subtract most of the sugar in these drinks and leave us with a near flavorless, almost diet-like drink to suit the kids better. Was this a good idea? Maybe health-wise yes, but not if you actually want to enjoy one of these. What the hell happened? These drinks used to be good! Now all I can say is that I will only reach into the fridge for one of these when there is nothing but water and cranberry juice available! They taste nearly as bad as the new and \"improved\" \"flavor-sucked-dry\" Huggie drinks. Yuck! Absolutely dreadful.2 (deserved) stars. I was expecting a larger granual suger and am dissapointed in this product. I might as well have used normal grocery store ganular sugar (i.e., Domino).  Not worth returning and I would not buy again. It certainly doesnt fit my description of \"sanding\" sugar. I was expecting a larger granual suger and am dissapointed in this product.

They refuse to ship this fine tea to Canada.  I have to go to the Middle East to find it and bring it back. The taste and consistency of the Nutive Hemp Shake were great.  Its packed with fiber, protein, and nutrients and with only 80 calories per serving.  Unfortunately, the shake did not agree with me, and it gave me terrible gastrointestinal distress.  I had horrible bloating and foul gas from it, and I had to discontinue drinking it. I have tried a lot of different powders, and while I like that this one has fewer calories, the taste is just not that good. Its hard to describe - it actually is very hempy, if you are familiar with the taste. Thats fine if you like it, but I didnt think it went well with chocolate. Its also very strong and sweet.There is also very little texture added by the powder, so smoothies made with this are thinner than those made with other protein powders. The flavor is not very good- tastes very artificial. Also I seemed to get a stomache ache after using the product, and I see in the reviews that Im not the only one. Its only redeeming quality is that the texture was fairly good, in that it dissolved well into soymilk. Otherwise it would have only been one star. I ordered the chocolate hemp shake hoping that it would be easier to drink (or for that matter, to keep down) than the bulk protein powder, but I was not impressed. The only liquid I seem to be able to get this to mix into without having large lumpy chunks was coffee-hot coffee. Im not sure what the high temperature does to the protein, so this left me a little frustrated. If you want hemp protein I would actually suggest just buying the bulk protein and dealing with the bad taste. The meat tastes GREAT. Unfortunately the shipping was 4 times the cost of the meat. I had looked into buying this 2 months earlier but never finished the order because of the outrageous shipping cost. Then I was placing a quick order for schoolbooks for my son and this was still in my cart. I had forgotten about the shipping cost and ended up buying it. I didnt find out until it arrived that I had paid $79 shipping for a $20 product.On a positive note, it was delicious. This honey is good. But I cant understand why the price is changed so frequently. One month ago I bought it at Subscribe price 34USD. This time I bought it at Subscribe price 40.83USD. But now it is 39.86USD. From the price aspect I dont recommend it. The good thing about the Chipotle flavor is generally that the smoked jalapenos are a bit milder and more flavorful than regular (raw) jalapenos.  That is NOT the case with this powder.  This \"Chili Chipotle Powder\" is HOT HOT HOT, and seriously lacking in flavor.The other thing is that this is an extremely fine grind, so when I sprinkle it into a sauce, enough of it enters the air and I end up inhaling it, and it feels like Im burning my nose.  YUCK!Stick with a plain old generic \"chili powder\" instead of this. Stash Tea Company Cranberry PomegranatePrice: >$4 ordered in a 3 pack less than $10 (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046KO7JA\">Stash Tea Company Autumn Teas Trio Gift Set, 3-Ounce</a> + Free Shipping)Caff-O-Meter: 0mgIngredients: Hibiscus; Rooibos; Cranberry Flavor; Pomegranate FlavorReceived this as part of a 3 pack of teas for the holidays (Cinnamon Vanilla, Pumpkin Spice and Cranberry Pomegranate).-Smell (2) - The smell is not strong, but it is present. I am not a big fan of the smell of cranberry so that may be why the score is low, if you enjoy that smell you may be surprised.-Taste+Unsweetened:++Hot (1) - Flavor is very bland, if not for the smell I would think I was drinking hot water with the tiniest bit of flavoring.++Iced (1.5) - Tastes a bit better over ice. but a bit thinned down*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.-Sweetened++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again Im not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor.++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.-2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea). I love peanuts and I also love salt but these nuts have very little taste EXCEPT salt.  Believe me, there is not much that I consider \"too salty\" but these certainly qualify.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, they are bland - not peanut-y.  Trader Joes \"blister peanuts\" are far superior to these. Indeed, I think a commercial brand like Planters is probably superior (and much cheaper).  After this purchase, I am still on the lookout for peanuts better than I can purchase in the grocery store.Sorry I got them. I love awake tea, but I am mad that you cant get the labels off the tin to reuse it. Nor can you compost the nylon bags.  The packaging is not earth friendly.  Even though I love the tea leaves less chopped-up, I buy the other packaging.  Whats wrong with you Tazo? Starbucks?  It cant be that bad to use a different glue for the cute tins so we can store rubber-bands in them!It cant hurt your profit margin too much to use another fabric for your tea bags.  As soon as you do I will be a loyal customer! These reviews are all from sometime ago, and perhaps what was said was true at that time. But let me warn anyone looking for some good Rwandan coffee right now, do not waste your money. I have tasted true good Rwandan coffee, which is very similar to Kenyan coffee. Most African coffees taste naturally citrus sweet. I dont know what was in the bag I got. The aroma was terrible (like the beans had partially absorbed some odd flavor from something else) and it tasted just the same. I had to toss the 3 pound bag. I love cherries ripe, jammed, dried, any way I can get them.  Ive eaten lot of different kinds of dried fruit from different providers. These were stale and I ended up throwing them out. I recently did a taste test with my family between two store bought pizza sauces. Pastorelli and Don Pepino. They both sell for roughly the same price, both are natural with no preservatives, so the only factor being judged here is taste. The Don Pepino won favoritism amongst my large family by 100%. The issue with the Pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the Pastorelli. Im not sure about everyone else, but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts (crust, sauce, & cheese) compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three. The Don Pepino did just that. At the end of the night all of the Don Pepino slices were gone but there were plenty of Pastorelli slices left. Very disappointed with the taste of this product;it really lacks flavor.In the future i will wait until Schluckwerder Marzipan is back in stock. After opening the box it looking like it fell down a set of stairs.  Most of the crackers in the packages were cracked and full of crumbs.  My husband is gluten intolerant and he likes these crackers.  I guess we wont be ordering them this way again.  We are both very disappointed. The cake arrived askew (smooshed, like a smiley) more due to the internal packaging -- it looks like it should have been vacuum sealed.Overall the taste wasnt what I expected - it was kinda yucky/pasty.  The ingredients show corn syrup, which is not suitable for a rum cake glaze.  The taste is likely due to use of a starch.  Its not \"terrible\" per se, but I doubt Id buy another.I think they can improve the recipe quite a bit. Be cautioned, do not order these in the summer.  No protection was taken to protect these from the summer heat, so I received a 5 lb bag of gummy goo!  The entire bag was liquid when I received it. Bought this candy to try it as a fill in snack. Not a fan of gummi stuff. So, that was my mistake. But, the strawberry flavor is ok. The bag is gigantic. So its good if you have a lot of kids to eat them. They advertise a five pound bag, theyre not kidding. Some of the cookies were crumbled.  I also found out that these cookies routinely sell for $2.50 each at walgreens.  Paying more that $4 per for some crubled cookie did not go well.  I will not be purchasing this items again. My wife loves these biscuits so I thought I would surprise her and buy a Family Pack of 5. They arrived packed in a box with the other items I purchased which included a heavy can of syrup and a can of pectin, neither of which were fully secured inside the box. Although they tasted as good as usual, my wife was very disappointed since so many of the biscuits were broken, probably around 20%. I doubt whether we will buy these on-line again. While these cookies are very tasty, I would have liked that all the cookies in the package were whole. we have opened 4 out of the 5 packs each pack had almost half the cookies crumbled or broken. I found out about these cookies while on a Delta flight. The two pack in which I was given were not damaged I was given 4 packs in all and all of them were fine. The ship box could have been a little larger and better padded. First off let me say I am a foodie. The 2 \"energy\" bars tasted terrible. Of course the other 3 ice cream products are delicious. But for almost $17.00 it is not worth it. Oh and the magnet is just a advertisement and didnt stick to the fridge. I usually drink French Roast, either Peets or the Costco variety. This coffee had a distinctive burnt taste, much more pronounced than Peets. It is drikable, but certainly not in the same league. Will not return, but will only use in lattes, where the taste is mitigated by the milk I dont enjoy this blend much, but as another reviewer mentioned perhaps it needs a Melitta coffee maker for its full potential.Ive made 3 pots:First I followed the instructions (2 level teaspoons per 6 ounces). I got brown colored water.Then I doubled it. Tasted kind of like a cheap grocery store canned brand.Finally I filled a #4 filter about 1/3 full to about 9 oz of water. That produced the best results, but I still just wasnt thrilled with the flavor.So you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, I normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isnt the issue. I do normally grind my own, but again pre-ground wont cause that big of a difference. My preferred daily coffee is Safeway house brand medium roast Colombian, but lately due to finances Ive been drinking a dollar store brand called \"Eight OClock\" thats of similar (though different) quality to the Melitta.My suggestion is if youd like a quality coffee in this price range look at Seattles Best (Starbucks milder step child) or if you have a Safeway their house brand beans are quite good.Edit: I compared the Melitta today with a similar Millstone (Medium Roast Colombian Supremo). The Millstone was much better. Background:  I am a big fan of Trader Joes coffee.  We have a Bunn Coffee Maker with the slow sprayhead and a Capresso Burr Grinder.  So, I guess you could say that my husband and I really like our coffee.  I usually use a combo of The Joes coffee at TJs and the decaf Columbian.  I do make it strong--I just realized how strong when I googled it a moment ago.This Coffee:  I used 1 Tbsp per 5-7 oz. cup.  I couldnt find the directions on the package as some people did--it must have been in small print.  It was like mud.  Way too strong.  Even so, I didnt like the flavor of the coffee.  It reminded me a lot of store bought Maxwell House or Diner coffee.  It had a bit of a burnt aftertaste to it for me.So, for me, Im going to stick with Trader Joes coffee. We enjoy our morning coffee and, years ago, bought an espresso machine to stop paying so much money over to Starbucks.  Not only do we like coffee, but we know what we like and this isnt it.Flat bottom drip coffee makers use a medium grind to brew a perfect cup; while cone filtered drip pots can use a fine grind.  However this coffee is ground, according to the package, extra fine.  This type of grind is typically used in espresso machines, not drip coffee makers.  I have to wonder how much the grind affects the flavor of this coffee.The flavor is smooth, and non-acidic, while at the same time bland and forgetful.  We usually use a tablespoon of grounds per cup.  We tried the two teaspoons, as recommended on the package, which resulted in a weak cup of coffee.  Using our norm, the coffee had more flavor, but wasnt good.The only good thing about this coffee is using the used grounds in the garden.  Im seriously thinking of soaking the remaining grounds so I can toss them in the garden.  If you are looking for a true European coffee, try Lavazza or Illy.PROS:Used grounds can be used in the gardenNot bitter or acidicCONS:Bland & forgetful flavor Neither of our cats was the least bit impressed with this product. The flakes did arrive as scheduled, but remain unused except for small amounts that were presented to the cats in various ways in hopes that they would find the flakes appealing. No joy. IdealBased on my experience with iced tea and coffee ,Ideal is about as sweet as ½ or 1/3 of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FMIMNK\">Sweet N Low Zero Calorie Sweetner - 1500 Packets</a>. Quite frankly Im disappointed that this doesnt work as well as<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UAL0M\">Sweet N Low, Zero Calorie Sweetener, 0.035-Ounce Packets (Pack of 2000)</a>.I cant recommend this.Gunner April, 2012 I bought this because the price was good and it was convenient to carry to restaurants. I have been using xylitol for several years and like that it has NO aftertaste.  This product has a bad aftertaste.  The little bit of sucralose they added to the xylitol to make the product sweeter takes over and leaves a sickening aftertaste.  If you are used to using Splenda or other sucralose based products you probably will not notice it but I really did.  Will not be buying this product again. These crackers are great.  Unfortunately, every box Ive bought is about 50% broken.  And thats from several different stores. keebler townhouse olive oil crackers taste OK but are a waste of money when 80% of minicrackers are broken into 1\" pieces Why the heck cant Townhouse just get crackers right for once? Remember that feeling of dread you got when you slept over a friends house and they had brands/foods not part of your world? Thats the feeling that these crackers arise. A little too crunchy, a little too \"fried\", a little too much olive oil/spice imbibed (yes, despite the olive oil and sea salt proclamation on the box, there is garlic and onion present). Hey, you see these at your next sleepover, make up a rambling excuse referencing obscure food allergies, and flee. This was just not my cup of tea - er, I mean coffee (har har). It had a sharp, acrid taste to it, and left a bitter aftertaste. Im not a coffee connosisseur by any means, but I know what I like and I know what I dont like, and I dont like this. I would not recommend it, especially with so many other Keurig coffee options. This Barista Prima Italian roast is suppose to be full bodied with a sweet edge.  It is not.  It is Medium-Bold (not extra bold), and has a bitter taste and a distinct aftertaste.  Milk & sugar help, but the bitter and aftertaste are still there.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL512\">Tullys Coffee Italian Roast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> is a much better choice if you want a good Italian blend.Disclosure: I received this kcup in a free sample pack mailed by Keurig to its customers. I order a 6-pack of large dog chicken pill pockets every month.  The vendors vary; I buy from whichever vendor offers free shipping.  The last time I ordered, the pill pockets were all crumbly and torn inside the packages.  They werent dried out; they were just torn up.  I had to mush our meds onto the pill pockets and mash shreds into a ball to get enough to cover the meds (my dog takes about 5 pills per meal, poor baby).  Anyway, every pouch was the same way.  I made sure to order from a different vendor this time even though its hard to see how the vendor would be at fault for the product.  Regardless, Ive never seen this before and I hope not to see it in my next shipment; if I do, back they go! Was disappointed with this oil.  Not much flavor and had to use a lot to make up for the lack of taste. This tray is huge, bulky, and awkward in the freezer.  It makes 2 oz portions, which are fine if you want to feed your baby 2 ounces of the same food, but I like to combine one ounce of this with one ounce of that.  Also, the cubes are fairly impossible to pop out of the tray.  You can run it under hot water as other users have done, but that makes a big wet avocado-ey mess.  I prefer to use regular ice cube trays with some saran wrap on top! The seeds sprout well, it is true, but there is a bitter taste to this mixture. I use them on sandwiches and I thought there was something wrong with the non-fat mayo. Plain alfalfa sprouts taste much better. Dont waste your money on these.  These are practically flavorless, yet still feel a little greasy in your mouth.  Yuck.If youre looking for some great onion-flavored snacks, just buy the Alexia Onion Strips.  Theyre light years ahead of these.  Seriously. This stuff is ok, not great but not bad. Trying to find anything made of real ruffle and only real truffle is futile. As far as I can tell, and from my research, no company in the world makes a truffle oil that is only made with real truffles and tastes ok. This stuff is only good for using at Olive Garden. I have had real truffles only once that I can recall, and that very old memory is of a sublime taste.  The slippery terminology used for truffle oil gave me pause, but I decided to take a chance.  To me, \"infused\" implies that something has been marinated in a liquid, not that a chemical has been simply mixed in.  Sure enough, the ingredient list on the bottle is limited to olive oil and truffle \"aroma.\"When I opened the bottle, I could only detect a garlic-like aroma, pleasant but not sublime.  I first tried adding 1/4 teaspoon to a small serving of scrambled eggs, and could detect nothing.  Today I made a two egg (1/2 cup of eggbeaters) omelet flavored with tarragon and filled with simple sauteed potatos, scallions, and mushrooms.  I drizzled on a full teaspoon of the truffle oil after the omelet was set, immediately before filling and folding it.Again, I could discern no flavor or aroma other than the above ingredients.  I rated this at 2 stars rather than one on the charitable assumption that a younger nose might detect some sort of aroma. Ive been on a ginger ale kick lately and switched to diet since every brand of regular ginger ale I can find sweetens their drinks with high fructose corn syrup instead of just regular sugar. Anything made with or from corn makes me ill, so Ive been drinking. Ive had the diet Canada Dry version, as well as various store brands from Brookshires, Albertsons, etc. I ran to the grocery store near work today to pick up something and grabbed a six-pack of Vernors as there were no other options for diet ginger ale.The after-taste is almost like saccharine, even though it is sweetened with Aspertame. It is reminiscent of TAB soda. The taste of ginger ale is there, but there is a chemical-esque taste as well - almost soapy.I wont be getting this brand ever again. Was led to believe that this product was individual tea bags not loose tea which requires special brewing equipment and now Im stuck with product I cant move.  Chef Joseph I purchased this nylabone for my 4 month old teething puppy. I figured shed enjoy a tasty chew toy. Shes quite the chewer so I was thinking the bone would last a day or two at best. However that was wishful thinking! In less than 20 minutes, she had consumed all of it but the bulky end (which we threw away). We couldnt believe how quickly she chewed it up! Definitely not worth the $8. This bone is nothing more than a big dog treat.  I have a 2 yr old Pit who ate through the souper in 5 minutes.  After reading other reviews I took it away from him and will save the rest for a later date.  I was hoping for a bone that would last a little bit longer as a chew toy and not just be eaten like a treat.  Will not be buying this again. I was under the impression when I bought this at our local pet supply store (based on salespersons advice) that this bone, while edible, would take several days of working on to be consumed.  Great.  Its a little pricey, but I have a teething 5 month old puppy who has recently been spayed; she cant get her regular course of exercise so I bought this as a nice treat to help keep her occupied in her restless state.  I took it away from her (mad dog!) after 45 minutes.  Just one end was left.  I had bought her the largest \"souper\" size.  After reading the other reviews, I count myself lucky that she got that much time out of it.  Yes its a \"treat\", but at $6, its a treat I cannot afford to give her very often.  Health wise its not a treat I could make a habit of feeding often; I feel I have to give my puppy less dinner tonight to make up for the large amount of calories she just wolfed down.  I hope that it doesnt make her sick as it did another reviewers dog.  I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.  All for a LOT less money.  That said, I give it 0 stars for value, 5 for \"my dog loved it\".  It gets a 2 overall from me and I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend to a friend. As the initial reviewer stated, the biggest issue with this product is its durability, or lack thereof.With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile.  I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist).  It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to clean up the mess.  If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  Its possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the plastic Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I cant justify it. I found this at Wholefoods for $2.50 and bought it mainly because of the cute bottle design. I had tried acai berry drinks before and arent crazy about their flavor, and this doesnt change that. This product has a taste that reminds me of Chinese medicine. White tea is already by itself very subtle. The combination of white tea, lemonade, and acai juice just doesnt work together. I also found it overly sweetened (28g sugar in the bottle). One bottle is 140 calories.In addition to white tea, acai juice, cane sugar and lemon juice, it has soy lecithin. Its a common food additive, but Im not sure what its doing in a tea. Maybe to keep the lemon and acai mixture from separating out. Thats nothing a good shaking cant fix.The bottle is too nice to throw out, so Ill reuse it for my own beverages. (The cap screws on.) Brewed and bottled in Chicago. I wont be buying this flavor again. Received product, which I purchased from Amazon.  Not a single cookie survived transit.  Nothing but crumbs.  Simply not worth getting from Amazon unless they do a better shipping job.  I would stay away from anything that is fragile at least in the sense of foods and groceries. well it was nice that they showed up early but they were all broken into itty bitty pieces. i didnt order pieces of cookies i ordered whole cookies. These cookies were ok, just ok.  I may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies, every last cookies was broken.  I understand this is probably due to poor packaging.  The consistency was a bit grainy and dry though.  And milk did not help.  Next time Ill purchase a chewy brand or Mrs. Fields. I love lemon marmalade.  They are hard to find, and in the last few years I could not find any in the stores so I decided to buy this Lemon marmalade without being able to look at it closely.  I am attaching a couple of pictures so you can see the content not just the label.I was looking forward to getting it so much. When the box arrived I opened it and tried the marmalade right away... but it was a huge disappointment.  First, it is no a true marmalade it is a jelly. I am attaching two pictures where you can see maybe a couple of lemon zest strips in the entire 454 gram (16 oz).  Second the jelly is soooo very sweet. There is not enough tartness I expected from a lemon marmalade. Third it had a weird texture, it left what I would describe as an oily feel in my mouth unlike any other jelly I have tried.List of ingredients:Sugar 62g per 100gGlucose-fructose syrupLemonsGelling Agent: Pectin, Citric AcidAcidity Regulator:Sodium CitrateFlavoring: Lemon OilColor:Caramel E150C Price with shipping slightly over $11.I eat a lot of different jams. I like having jam with my tea.  I will not be able to eat this jelly with my tea because I really did not like so many things about it. I will try cooking with it, maybe it will work on a chicken as a sauce.  I am so disappointed!8/22/11 UpdateNormally I would not comment on a specific seller on a product review, but I think in this case it is relevant.Enclosed with the marmalade was FoodIreland 100% satisfaction guarantee flyer with a contact email.  I contacted them over the weekend letting them know I was disappointed in the product. On Monday I received a notification of a full refund.  So if you like jellies the stellar customer service removes the risk of giving it a try. I am always looking for good tasting vegan products.  Although I enjoy other Dr. McDougall soups, I didnt care much for the White Bean & Pasta soup. I would not buy it again. This was just okay.  There are better choices like the Black Bean or Split Pea I ordered the ener g brand because that is the brand of bread we had a Disney and the kids (and one adult celiac) were very excited about everything they had there.  These brownies do not measure up to the bread that ener g makes.  Ive never met a brownie I didnt like but I couldnt eat it (even with ice cream).  The clear sign was when I had to throw some away.  They will eat them if they are desperate for something gluten free.  Anyone who has been dealing with gluten free products probably already knows to freeze the items until you get ready to use them.  They mold quickly. Very pretty to drop a few rose buds in a cup of tea but found it to have disappointedly weak rose flavor as a tea itself.Perhaps the other rose teas Ive had were infused with flavoring. Not sure. I got my nestle nestum cerelac and my product was open one of the can was open. I would like to no if there is an reimburse. Everyone seems to enjoy these so I think maybe Im missing something.  I microwaved them for slightly less time than instructed and only about 1/5 of them changed consistency from the little flat parallelograms to a slightly puffier flat paralleogram.  Next batch I did a little longer and a couple more of them puffed up a little bit.  Even the puffy ones seem to have patches of tremendously hardened pork(dont laugh) in them to a point where when you eat one and there are pork rind shards that break away from the puffy.  I tried one last time and microwaved them for a minute and a half longer than instructed and this time the puffy ones overcooked and burned and the others stayed in tiny, hard form(again, dont laugh).If anyone that orders these and learns any tips that I might be missing, please let me know. They will be in their resealable package in the pantry until that point or they expire.Thanks. These dont taste any better to me than pork rinds I can buy at the store in a bag, and they are WAYYYYYY more trouble to make. A large number of them wont puff up for me at all no mater how long I cook them, either. Maybe my microwave is underpowered, I dunno, but when even the puffed ones are not somehow tastier I just dont see the point. I feel like I really wasted my money on these. The pork rinds cooked up fairly well in the microwave, but the smell was less than appetizing and the taste was fair at best. I purchased this product based on the great reviews, with one reviewer even saying that its perfect for stuffing bleu cheese olives.  Great!  Thats what I wanted it for.  I figured Id be able to load this thing up with cheese and fill the olives quickly.  It turns out that that big green body on this tool is just filled with a spring and a rod, and you cant load it with cheese.  You can only fit enough cheese into a very small chamber for about one olive.  So you have to fill this little chamber with cheese by hand, and then it presses it into the olive.  Then you have to do it all over for your next olive.  You might as well just stuff the olive my hand instead of stuffing the stuffer.  Its kind of a weird concept.  It just doubles the time it would take you to get your olives ready.  If they could make one of these with a big chamber that could hold lots of cheese, wed be in business! Ordered OVEN ROASTED TURKEY NUGGETS*** for the first time. Meat is dry. Expiration date is too close; received today, SEPT 9, 2011, expiring NOV 21, 2011.In the past, have had very good experience with the Chicken Teriyaki nuggets. Jack Links used to use dark meat. Jack Links changed the recipe to white meat and the nuggets do not taste as rich any more.*** Very disappointed with Amazons approach on linking ALL Jack Links nuggets together. Meaning: If you post a review for the Chicken Teriyaki ones, you can NOT post one for the flaming chicken, turkey over roasted, etc.?! And the same review will show up under any and all of them. I contacted Amazon and customer service first tried to convince me I was doing something wrong. On the third e-mail, the senior CS guru indicated the nugget products are all linked together and nothing will be done about the issue. I would like to say that I have never tried a flavor of jerky that I didnt like...  that was true until a few days ago.  I wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef.  This was a mistake, I have to say this is the worst jerky/nuggets/meat product I have ever tried.  From the smell to the taste, just not good.  If you really want to give this stuff a whirl, I suggest you find a single pack.  Dont buy 4 of them like I did.  One final note:  taste is subjective, you may really love this stuff, I just didnt. All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jacks Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jacks links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe) these are good but verrry sweet.... they taste kind of chinese sweet bbq sauce... high protein My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I dont think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is \"made with liver\".My dogs absolutely love <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG\">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesnt have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.Specifically, these treats have chicken \"by-products\"-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Heres the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide. I was excited to offer these seemingly healthy treats to my dog, as I love other Newmans Own products such as their spaghetti sauce.  My dog Kirby was very excited as I opened the package and announced \"Ooooh, I have a treeeeeat for you!\" in the high pitched voice I use to get him worked up.  However, it was all downhill from there.  He eagerly took a cookie in his mouth, then gave me a look like \"Seriously?\"  He will eat them, but only if there is nothing better going.  My husband was going to try one to give a second opinion.  However, after smelling them he announced that they smell like burnt oatmeal and probably taste like it too, and he refused to try them.  I give these 2 stars because I would like my dog to eat them (as opposed to fatty pig ears), but he really doesnt care much for them.  He gets about as excited to eat these as I do to eat a Triscuit. We have three large dogs - two malamutes and a husky mix. Id read a few of the reviews on here that said that these treats were only good for large dogs, so I figured theyd be perfect for my three chow hounds. Unfortunately these are much smaller than I thought they were. Two, three bites tops and my dogs would have them down, and they didnt seem to like them as much as they like their regular bones (cheap, regular bones). So, nope, I dont think that these are that great, and apparently neither did my dogs. When I read the ingredients of these treats I thought for sure that my dogs would like these. I have 3 large breed dogs which usually love to eat just about anything. I have Rocky, a black and tan coonhound, Buddy, a blue heeler and a very large pit bull named Hutch. Rocky and Buddy have turned up their noses in disdain to these treats everytime I have offered them. The pit bull Hutch will eat them very grudgingly and even then hell leave half of the treat on the ground, this is odd because, hell eat just about anything including tree branches. So, I wouldnt pay the higher price for these treats, my dogs just dont like them. I like the ingredients that these biscuits have -- everythings organic -- meat, veggies, and grains.  Each biscuit comes in two squares, so I tried to break the biscuit in half to separate the two squares and found it very difficult.  Those biscuits were hard!  I also smelled the biscuits and didnt notice much flavor/scent at all.I gave one square each to my two dogs.  While my one-year-old dog gobbled it up (as she does with everything, and may have swallowed it whole for all I know), my six-year-old dog was hesitant at first.  He sniffed it a bit and then had a very hard time taking that first bite into the very hard biscuit.  I think he was afraid of breaking his teeth!  (And he chews on very hard toys/bones/rawhide.)  He didnt seem too wild about the taste either, as he wasnt in any rush to finish the square after he broke into it.  They looked and probably tasted like cardboard, so I can see why.I appreciate what Newmans is trying to do for dogs in giving them healthier snack alternatives, but please dont break my dogs teeth! My 35-lb dog could not break these treats by chewing on them. She gave up after only a minute or so and decided to look elsewhere for a treat.I was unable to break the treats in two even though they are scored across the middle.My toy breed dog thought it was fun to play with, but he couldnt get much headway trying to chew it either, and never ate it.They need come out with something soft! Got these free in the Newmans Own Dog Food bag. My dogs have been fans of the other Newmans treats in the past, but this is a whole other story. One dog played with hers for a few minutes and then abandoned it (eating it several hours later). The other one took a bite and decided she didnt like it. Nice to get free treats, but I would never buy them! Both of my dogs, including the one that eats dirt off the floor, were unimpressed with these treats. The resealable bag is nice, but if the dogs dont eat the treat it isnt very helpful.If your dog does like these treats, it is convenient that they come in large wafers that are prescored to break in half for smaller dogs. I got this thinking that it would be a great organic treat for my Lab/Rhodesdian Ridgeback mix puppy. I figured giving him a treat like this would really satisfy his chewing instinct. This treat is VERY hard. It comes in a rectangle shape that is divided in half and I tried to break it into two smaller treats and had a difficult time. My dog did not like the flavor either. He preferred to play with these rather than eat them. Usually he will eat a treat in about a minute but this treat stayed in his cage with him picking it up and dropping it for hours. He has very powerful jaws and he usually tears up most of his toys in a day or two, yet he did not wont to eat these very much. Whatever they put in this is not very appealing to dogs apparently.Your dogs may like this better (hopefully). Again this is a VERY hard threat so make sure your dogs don t mind having to gnaw at it for awhile. Also, if your dog acts like it doesnt like it then it probably never will, so give the pooch a different treat. We dont have a dog, but we pet-sit for the neighbors and were hoping these treats would be welcome.  Sadly, the hound just pushed one around the floor and then abandoned it under the table.  Is it because theyre so terribly hard ?  Is it some flavor (or lack of flavor) that only dogs can sense ?  Too bad the hound cant read and cant tell why these treats should be such a good healthy treat for him. This is one of the first crackers I tried, yes if your gluten free it may work but doesnt hit the spot like regular crackers.  There are MUCH better alternatives for you.  The crackers are chalking tasting and no one in the family liked them.  We did find that Glutino nows sells a VERY good Table Cracker.  Little more expensive but they are great for your soups, chilis, meatloafs and taste just about like a saltine.  You cant go wrong with Table Crackers.  Also try nut thins - had more compliments on those crackers then with these. Dont waste your money on them (regular, cheese or veggie) YUCK! My sons celiac so were very familiar with gluten free products.  I bought these because I trust the Glutino brand name but really, theyre just not that great.  We tried them once and that was it because theyre bland and tasteless.  There are better gluten free alternatives out there. Amazons excellent customer service allowed me to receive a replacement box of these crackers when I started opening the bags and finding tiny pieces of crackers.However, the second box came exactly the same way.The taste of the Original crackers is a lot like a water cracker. Not much to it but its absolutely perfect for whatever topping or filling youre using.I would order them constantly if they were not all broken upon arrival. I ordered 6 boxes of these crackers. The crackers are very good, however, all of the crackers (in all 6 boxes) were nothing but crumbs when I received them! Food is very much a personal preference but I really dont like any of these crackers made by this company. They taste like flavored paper. Someone said better than nothing but Id rather have something else. Glutino crackers are among our favorite GF crackers, but if you have a store in your area that sells them, that might be a better bet. About half of our crackers (in all 6 boxes) arrived broken. Based on our experience I would give this product 1 star, but I concede that our dogs reaction may not be typical.We gave our dog one of these early in the evening.  Hes a mid-sized dog at about 35 lbs, but hes also a strong chewer.  Based on what I could tell from the package, though, I had no reason to believe I should buy the larger size.  We were in the room and casually observed him as he chewed on it.  Our dog had the whole thing eaten within an hour.He seemed fine and the next morning his bathroom routine was completely normal.  However, when we got home from work, it was clear that the poor guy had been struggling not to have an accident.  When we got him outside, he had multiple explosive bowel movements.  A little further examination showed us that, despite his best efforts, his butt had been leaking during the day.  He had also given himself a hemorrhoid.  The poor guy.We double checked the package and found no directions, advice, or warnings that would have helped us foresee this issue.  I never want my dog to go through that again and thus we will never buy these again (and the extras have gone in the trash). Read through the other reviews and you will find the same situation I had with the creamers.  It does not arrive in the blue dispenser box that is shown, the 192 creamers arrive loose inside a cardboard box with no padding.  Perhaps less creamers would burst during transit if the display box shown was wrapped inside a cardboard box.  The box arrived completely undamaged on the outside. None appeared to have frozen during transit, it appears that the creamer singles pop during high altitude transit or perhaps when the box is thrown by the shipper or pressure is placed on the box.  It is a sticky mess when it arrives.  The creamer taste and convenience is great, but it is unfortunate that so many people have commented on this problem and Interational Delight has not fixed its packaging and shipping issue. This product was what I like. But this shipment looks like 2eds. not good enough for the store shelves. Containers were dented and some had leaked out making everything sticky. The creamer is fine, it was the creamers that had exploded in the box that were the problem. The few that did break open left the whole box covered and sticky. So I had to go and hand wash all of them before putting them out for our staff and clients. Simply irritating... MORE OF THE PRODUCT IN THE PACKING BOX ARE LEAKING OUT, AT LEAST 10 OF THE SINGLE SERVE PACKAGES LEAK OUT IN THE BOX. WITH ALL THE CREAMERS I HAVE ORDERED THROUGH YOU HAVE PACKAGES THAT HAVE LEAKED ALL OVER THE BOX. I AM LOOKING AT OTHER SOURCES FOR MY PRODUCT. Not very good and I love bold coffee. Kona coffee and pretty much Tulleys brand in general is MUCH better. The flavor of the Big Easy Bold is good. But, about every third cup overflows out the top of the cup making a huge mess. Its as if the hole on the bottom gets plugged and the remaining coffee has nowhere to go but out the top...and all over the place. If this happened two or three times Id give it four stars. I paid for 100 k cups but received only 98! This is the second time this has happened.I didnt think such about it the first time. Now I wonder if this happens often or even all the time. I dont know what it was about this Emerils big easy blend, if perhaps there was a hint of chicory, but I really did not enjoy this style of coffee people k cup whatsoever. Something was just off about it. I would try other flavors instead. Just purchased a 50 count box. Previous reviews had indicated that there were probblems with the cups and that they \"leaked\" grounds into the coffee cup. Sadly, this is still the case. About 1 in 5 cups is defective.Taste is fine as long as you dont mind chunky coffee. Will NOT be buying this again!!! I ordered these last month. Of the first six Ive tried, five have blown open and spewed coffee grounds all over our machine (as well as in the cup). Im getting rather tired of cleaning the Keurig. Normally, I buy our K-cups at local department store but buying in bulk here at Amazon was less expensive. Amazon has graciously replaced the first lot and I was told if this second lot has the same problems, to call them back and they will need to look at pulling the lot. After looking back at the reviews for this product, I think that would be a wise move considering many of us are having the same problem. Thankfully, Amazons customer service is 5-star so I havent lost my money. Received this order promptly, but am very disappointed in it.  Over half of the k cups have exploded in our Keurig.  When this happens it makes a huge mess.  The machine has to be totally cleaned each time.  It appears that the seal at the top of the kcups is not properly attached.  The ones that do survive make excellent tasting coffee, but I will not reorder them online again.  Very disappointed, makes some of the best tasting coffee we have tried, but only got to drink a little of it. I tried Pamelas Brownie Mix on the recommendation of a relative with celiac, about a year after I was diagnosed.  I was pretty disappointed; although moist with a very brownie-like texture, there is an aftertaste I didnt like that I notice in many GF baking mixes.  Also I agree with the comment about them tasting carob-y instead of chocolatey.  My non-GF family & friends said they were \"weird\" and \"different\".  Not terrible, but after I tasted one, I did not want another.  Im sticking with the flourless brownie recipe Ive been using; at least my family likes them. Everyone raves about Pamelas mixes, so I had high hopes. My kids seem to like them, so thats good. Perhaps if I had eaten them fresh from the oven I would have liked them more. I ate one the next day and found it to be the usual grainy, gritty texture I associate with gluten free products. After a few chews it was like a mouthful of mud. I will definitely be looking for something else. I dont know what kind of coffee these people giving this stuff 5 stars were drinking but this coffee honestly tastes like the beans were roasted to the point of charcoal.  Out of 54 people that I work with, only two like it.  I think somebody is getting paid to give this stuff a good review. The product arrived in good shape and in a timely fashion.I did not find this product to have the taste or aroma that its name and roast would warrant.  I would not likely order this product again. When i read that these were \"long lasting\" i was hoping for a chew that would take my take more than 2 minutes for my 9 month old chocolate lab and 9 year old lab to chew. Not happy with this nylabone purchase! Ive subscribed to receive Pamelas GF cookie mix and after the second delivery of OLD mixes I am returning to buying them in the store.  All of the last mixes during the last several months (6 bags per order x 2 = 12) have been OLD -- not expired, but the chocolate is dried up, light brown and crumbles to a powder.  I discovered its not possible to return a subscribe n save order (for some reason) so I have to throw out the chocolate chips and use Ghiradelli instead.  Whenever I have bought Pamelas from Whole Foods the chocolate in the mix has been dark brown, fresh and never has crumbled to powder.AVOID subscribe and save on this item.  Buy them in a store. Although its always nice to find gluten free products available to those who suffer from Celiac Disease, its also troubling to find many of these products also are high in sugar. I found this to be extremely too sweet for my taste. If I purchase something that is chocolate I want to taste chocolate not be overwhelmed by sugar.Rice flour in itself is high glycemic and with the added sugar this product made me feel ill from the sugar content. I have been baking for years the old fashioned way with whole wheat but after developing Celiac I no longer could consume it. I learned later from a nutritionist that sugar was also a problem for people who have Celiac. Through trial and error I found this to be so true. Cant the makers of these mixes back off on the sugar? I removed the chips as well as they were too sweet. Other than that its okay for a rice flour mix cause we all know rice does not compare to whole wheat. Watch out, we had a couple of bad tasting bags from a 40-count box from costco recently.  When opening up the third, many of the popcorn kernels inside were odd looking, inconsistent.  It is too bad, so now we are going to air popped popcorn, after using Orvilles  bags nearly daily for a few years.  Edens organic popcorn was OK so far, but harder to find.  Now will try Bobs (red mill?) popcorn kernels.  Hoping none of these are of the genetically modified type of corn. These werent great. They have a funny aftertaste. I probably wouldnt buy them again. Texture wise, they were great though. I love chocolate with cinnamon in it, and artisan chocolates in general, so i had such high hopes for this product. It disappointed me.First off, it was grainy, in a too-much-sugar way, not a coarsely-ground-cacao-way. If you break off a piece, you can see the sugar crystals glinting in the chocolate.Second, it had almost no flavor. I couldnt taste the cinnamon at all, and the even chocolate itself was weak.It smells wonderful, but tastes like grainy nothing. I bought these seeds in the hope they would be what Im used to.  Im sorry I did.  The seed pods are EXTREMELY small, theyre a re past prime, and somewhat bitter than normal cardamom.  Disappointed with this product from this seller. When i received my fly trap all of the traps were closed so i called the \"help line\" and asked the guy if that was normal. the man on the other line spoke such poor english i could hardly understand him, i had to get him to repeat everything he said. he told me that the heads closed were ok that they would open in a few weeks i was like well ok, so about a week passes and the traps still are closed and they begin to get black spots on them so i call the help line again and he says oh thats normal  it should go away in about a week . so time goes on and still the traps remain closed and the black has completely covered two of them. so i read online that if they get black spots on them to immediately pop the head off and a new one should grow back, so i did but the rest of the leaf just got really black and began to limp over.  ive had my fly trap for about 3 and a half weeks now  and they still havent lost the black on them, one of the heads have opened but it is dead. i did EXACTLY what the instructions said to do but still no luck. dont be fooled by the photo on this item it is NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE SIZE IN THE PHOTO. it is maybe a third of the size in the photo. very disappointed! This was not what I expected, tiny plant, followed instructions exactly.  Fly Trap never matured to potential. After 10 days appeared to collapse and by 21 days was dried out. I was sold that this product is great for gereatric cats, but not really. My 17 yr old cat can not keep this down. Vet feels because of the unknown source of grains she may continue to vomit up this food. If your cat is real old like mine I suggest trying a grain free food. Cats are carnivores so grains are only fillers in these types of foods. 2 stars for fast shipping I was on subscribe and save for these mints, but have switched to Spry due to Xylitol USAs awful company policy and customer service. If you buy something from Xylitol USA that arrives in bad shape and you want to return it for a refund, the company will tell you that they do not accept food back. When I insisted that the product was old (in my case two bags of xylitol sweetened dark chocolates that were old, whitish and tasteless) they said that they would NOT refund my money and, amazingly enough, offered a 25% discount on my NEXT purchase. I disputed the payment and my bank took care of the situation got me my  money back. No more purchases from this company for me. I thought these bars might be a good substitute for the Honey Nut Cherrios bar that I have for breakfast, I was wrong.Although they are both 40g bars the Cherrios bar is more filling.  They are about even on Calories but the Whenever Bar gets 80 of its 180 from fat, whereas the Cherrios bar gets only 35 of its 160 from fat.  The Whenever Bar has 15mg of Cholesterol, whereas the Cherrios bar has none.  The two bars are about even on Total Carbohydrates.To me this bar does not taste like Chocolate Chips - maybe that taste is overwhelmed by the heavy Coconut flavor.  If these were called Coconut bars, with a hint of Chocolate - maybe I would give them a higher rating - but, to me, the flavors are not as the product name would lead me to believe.I really was underwhelmed by this product, and unless you are a big Coconut fan, you probably want to buy something else. I tried this product because I love Pamelas baking and pancake for making chocolate chip cookies (and pancakes), and I was hoping this cookie would be good.  Well, the \"good\" is it has some decent ingredients (some fiber, aguave, rice blend flour-- no high frucose corn syrup) but the \"bad\" is it tastes terrible.  I couldnt even finish the one cookie (it comes in a small rectangular bar, maybe 2 and a half inches long by an inch plus wide and 1/2 inch thick.  Im usually pretty good with words, but although I like the texture, moist part of this cookie, the flavor is indescribably dreadful; I wish I could be more precise, it negatively tickles the taste buds.  You dont feel you would get sick eating it, but you might consider using it as a torture on someone. I would ask my wife to try it, but I want to live.  There are other better products on the market that taste much better, power bars, etc.  Some people may question aguave being \"good,\" but I think it is better than staight sugar or corn syrup--correction--there is some evaporated cane sugar in the product as well as coconut sugar. It has 180 calories, so keep that in mind. There is no one with celiac or gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance in my family, so I cannot really speak for the value of this product for them.  As for me, I dont think this is worth the money.Here are my test results:My 2 year old grandson loved them.  The 6 year old rejected them handily.I only tasted them lightly for reasons I will list below.They are gluten free and non dairy if you need that.They contain organic ingredients if that is what you are looking forBut:They have 8 g of sugars and these sugars are very heavy on the fructose.  Both agave and coconut sugars are 60 to 90% fructose.  Now, I choose not to argue with anybody who wants to defend fructose.  I am fructose intolerant so I dare not to even try eating these because of that.  I have read a lot of scientific literature about fructose and I have my opinions and the corn council has theirs.They have 180 calories per 40 gram serving which is too much for a snack for my purposes.  Yes, eating half would be only 90 calories, but half is barely a bite.Here is the kicker:  they have only 2 g of protein per serving so they would not be a good exchange for a meal.I tend to buy a far cheaper store brand version of Quaker oats granola bars. Ounce for ounce they have about the same amount of sugar and fat, far less saturated fat, and about the same number of calories, except they come in smaller 100 calorie packages so I only eat that one. I find them filling enough to be satisfying. The grandsons love them and everybody is happy. Coconut is the dominate flavor and texture in these cereal bars. If you dont like coconut then avoid them. The picture also shows chocolate, which is in there for sure, but it is overpowered by the other flavors.The bar itself isnt very appetizing looking. It looks like a wad of granola trail mix was mixed with oils or butter then squashed. This is also about what it tastes like.The rest of the box will get eaten as soon as all other snacks have been eaten and they are the only snack left. These taste really awful. Ive tried plenty of choc chip coconut cookies but these are barely edible. My guests werent delighted when I asked them to try these. Dont recommend. I wouldnt buy these again. They are way to sweet, not fling, and do nothing to curb appetite.  Not sure what I expected of these but I would not buy them again.  There are far better products out there for the price. I was disappointed when I received this bonsai desert rose for a number of reasons.First, the packaging.  I have mail ordered other bonsai so was disappointed at how much dirt came out during the unwrapping process.  I would highly recommend you unwrap outdoors, perhaps on grass where you dont care about the dirt.Second, the bonsai I received is not the one shown, or even really much like it.  I was hoping for the gnarled, twisted root and trunk look in the picture.  What I received was basically a fat trunk, no gnarls, no twists.  There are feeder roots coming off the trunk almost 3 inches above the dirt level.  The base does not seem firmly rooted in the pot at all.  In fact, if you grasp the trunk, you can easily lift the entire rootball out of place, without disturbing much of the surrounding soil or decorative pebbles.  Almost like it was just shoved into the pot for shipping to me.  It was advertised as suitable for a beginner, but I am going to have to do some quick research and see about repotting it more securely into the pot.  Far from what I was hoping for.Third, the plant ccame with a sheet of general instructions, not specific to this type of plant.  The first paragraph tells you how vitally important a humidity tray is for the plants well being.  Why not add $7 to the price and include the darn thing rather than making me call in a separate order and pay for more shipping.Fourth, who the heck is Sheryl?  I made this purchase based on another review which mentioned how nice Sheryl was to deal with on a problem.  This shipment came from Lous Bonsai--no Sheryl in sight.  Not that it really matters, but it seems odd.I have been bitten by the bonsai bug hard and intend to purchase more, but I most likely will not buy another bonsai from this seller.  There are other sellers available on Amazon and over the internet that will ship you exactly what you see in the picture, rooted into their pots appropriately, etc.  I gave the review two stars because the plant itself seems basically healthy. I agree with the other review. Beware: the plant is not as pictured or anything like it. I purchased this Desert Rose for my dad because he fell in love with the one in the photo and the description (~15 years old desert rose). The Amazon shipping weight says 21lbs, mine was UPS 3lbs. I was totally disappointed as I paid $95 with shipping just to get a desert rose that does not look like its 15 years old. The caudex on the plant I got was only ~2-3\" wide and the one in the photo looks about ~6-7\"+ wide.I contacted Lou immediately (I also have no idea why the sellers name is Sheryl when the actual seller is LouBonsai) and he is great at responding. He told me he would ship me a new plant and I kept emailing to make sure its not just ANY desert rose, but SPECIFICALLY the one similar to the photo. However, their responses were brief and not descriptive about what they are sending (i.e. the response was \"BIGGER AS I WAS TOLD\"). I felt as if my concerns were not answered. Lou said he was going to send me a new plant with a tracking number on 7/23 but I heard nothing. I had to email him on 7/25 to ask, they provided one and said I was able to track it the next day. Its 7/27 now and the UPS tracking number still says that a label has been created but package is not dropped off yet. Im a very disappointed customer at this point.It would be nice for them to list the actual plant they are selling because its definitely not the one I received.2 stars for responsiveness. I thought I was getting a healthy alternative to cheese its and cheese nips. But after comparing the labels, I was surprised to see that the Back to Nature ones have basically the same ingredients (nothing organic) and MUCH MORE sodium than the major brands.Seems they just put regular crackers in a healthy looking box and got away with charging a premium. I bought this a few years ago and really liked it.  They must have changed the recipe because this just tasted odd, sort of medicinal. I thought I was buying non pareil candy (like snowcaps), but instead it was a container of sprinkles. Ill find a use for them, but I was hoping for a stocking stuffer (heck maybe Ill make it stocking stuffer andyway).  I would have been better to see a picture of the container- so I knew it wasnt candy. It may have 30 fewer calories per packet than the maple-brown sugar instant oatmeal, but you can really taste the missing calories. I cant even eat it hot anymore, the \"apple\" flavor is so weirdly bitter and unpleasant. It makes me hate breakfast. okay, its freeze-dried liver cube-lets.  my common sense tells me that for a lot less than the price of this treat i could buy real liver, cube it and freeze it.  it would serve the same purpose for a lot less money, and it would not be over-processed.that said, our dog would do back flips for this treat, so if youre made of money, go ahead.  youll make your dogs day  :-) Same price as Dr. Foster & Smith. I wanted to like this wine because I really like Bethenny, but the wine just isnt good.  It really tastes and smells like vinegar. I had so hoped they would be close or better than Cheetos Flamin Hot but they arent. They were NOT past the expiration by  3 months but they did taste stale and almost flavorless even though you get a tiny after burn. I gave the rest of the case to the food shelter. My husband and I went Gluten Free earlier this year due to a health condition.  We stumbled across this product at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  These were incredible...  so cheesy and spicy!!!  So much so, we decided to buy a case on Amazon.  Once our original case was depleted, we re-ordered, and though the product looks identical, the new case contained cheese curls with little to no seasoning.  They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.  What a letdown... Well this review is specifically for the Sea Salt flavor of these chips. I so wish I had tried another flavor, Dill or a couple others sound good but I will never know. I am not a fan of the flavor I had. Or better yet the lack of flavor. These tasted like health food more than I had hoped ( Like rice cakes ) and I wanted to write a 1 star review but felt it somewhat dishonest as the other flavor may be ok, others seem to like these but I will never try another and still have so many bags left. Grrrrr I saw this product on Oprah and wanted to try it, I was impressed that it was vegetarian and lower fat then mayo. I thought it would make good \"BLTs\", but without the real beacon. It was just OK for me. The product does come as described and tastes OK, but something about it just tasted too fake and I didnt like the texture. Its not real creamy lake mayo, or even low-cal mayo. I like low-cal fry sauce a lot better. I have to say though, its just a taste thing, and someone else might love it. I still use it on burgers, (mixed with light mayo), but no one in my family really cares for it that much.I wasnt happy that with free shipping it took a month before it was even sent out, that seemed a little ridiculous. The packaging was good. I like that the jars are plastic and not glass. However, I would not purchase again or recommend, because the flavor is just OK. tastes vaguely of bad fish. Good idea but its a bit off putting. Nothing can replace real bacon plus real mayo. Certainly does not taste like bacon, but is good on a cold turkey sandwich.  If you are looking for a smoked flavor spead this is the spread for you.  Wouldnt every buy it again. We got a box of this along with our Keurig brewer from Costco. We have three coffee drinkers in the house and all of us are fond of strong, dark-roasted coffee.  This blend is underroasted and weak.  The one good point is that it isnt as sour as most cinnamon roasts are.  We ended up throwing out half the box because I couldnt get anybody to drink it.If youre a fan of very mild medium-roasts youll probably enjoy this.  If you like coffee strong and dark with some body to it youll hate it. This coffee is extremely weak. It lacks flavor, like drinking a cup of hot water, yuck! Not what I expected from Green Mountain and the name \"Nantucket Blend\". Although the coffee had no reached the expiration date, I felt this coffee was borderline stale.  Im not sure how far out these products are packed to the expiration date, but wished it would have been fresher.  As these little packets are somewhat expensive, I was hoping for more. The Ingredients arent from Nantucket, the blend is not smooth. Too heavy  or something maybe too much arabica.then today I learn Green Mountain Coffee is involved with this:Burlington, Vermont - October 25, 2010Could a routine inquiry into accounting practices at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters lead to an insider trading investigation? A Wall Street whistleblower believes its possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountains \"revenue recognition practices.\" And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16-percent drop in Green Mountains stock price.A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop. And Antar says the timing of the stock sale is the kind of thing that could trigger an insider trading investigation.Not recommending this at all. Try the Donut Shop Kuerig Coffee its a lot better blend.. Green Mountain now colors the box light green but this product is caffeinated. Wife got Snookered caused she thought Medium roast didnt have caffeine; just cause the box was light green. Dont you get fooled too.  Coffee had a bitter taste had to put MORE French Vanilla creamer in it to make it have a smoother taste. ( that was medium roast)  Going back to Newmans Medium roast Decafe..by Kuerig. Ive had to hunt far and wide to find the right K-cups for me.  Generally, I like coffee people donut shop, and that had been my go to coffee for a while.  The dark bold coffees are way too intense for me, but the mediums are generally way too weak.  Wanting to try something new, I followed the reviews and tried this coffee thinking it would be a good strong but-not-too-strong alternative.It wasnt.  If I use two pods, this is a decent, but weaker, coffee for me to use in my travel cup for the ride into work.  Otherwise, it is much too weak.  I was very surprised that the first time I brewed some and poured in half and half, the coffee turned very light brown.  It was almost white.  I will get through this package, but I will not buy again.  Its not cost effective for me to use two pods to be satisfied.  Any other suggestions? Green Mountain Coffee, Nantucket Blend is my favorite coffee to use in my Keurig Brewer.  However, in this particular box, the coffee did not taste fresh.  Perhaps due to the large quantity in one box, it remained in storage too long.  At any rate, previous orders from other Amazon sellers, like az trading llc and pm trading, and smaller-quantity boxes from Amazon.com LLC were far superior. Quality is OK but if you need maltodextring in larger but not huge quantities, buy Carbo Gain from NOW Foods. Much better bang for the buck. Received product timely.  Upon opening product found weevil infestation. Put product in freezer to kill weevils.  Returning product would have been a nuisance. The cans are listed as 13 fluid ounces each, but I measured and each can was 12 ounces or less.  Since you have to have equal parts water and formula, I had to carefully measure each can.  Each can was different.  The formula itself worked fine, but it was misleading as to how much I was actually getting for the price.  The already mixed formula is much cheaper per ounce than this or even the powder. The sugar salt combo season is so bad that I soaked them in water, washed out the canister and air dried them. Then and only then were they tasty. Normally I love walnuts, however I regret this purchase.  The nuts are coated in a savory seasoning with paprika, garlic, and veggie flavoring.I was expecting something sweet or plain which I could throw on my morning oatmeal.However, they arent a bad product, if you like salted and seasoned nuts.  I can only compare it to garden vegetable flavored crackers. The quality is decent overall, just not a flavor I enjoy.  The packaging is lightweight and portable, which is nice to grab on the go for snacking. I purchased this product and tried it for a few days to see if I could get use to the taste.  Ive used a lot of Splenda and like it.  Ive started low carbing and wanted to cut the carbs out that are included in Splenda.  Ive used this in ice tea and it tastes bitter .  Ive tried it for 3 days now, and I still get the bitter taste after drinking it.  I did a little research online and have heard the same complaints from some other users.  The problem is believed to be all the preservatives that are added.  I thought I was getting pure sucralose and didnt realize there are added preservatives to this product.  I have since found that there is one website that sells pure liquid sucralose with no added preservatives.  Some people buy powdered sucralose and make their own liquid using only purified water.  I hope this helps. The candy arrived with some white waxy stuff on it; almost as if it had partially melted at one point.  Tasted chalky.  Not interested in a partial refund.  Next time find a way to make sure candy is not stale. I ordered this item and several other choclate items from Euro Food Mart and was sorely disappointed in the products I received. They arrived melted. I didnt realize that I needed to have them shipped EXPEDITED. I mistakenly assumed that by paying $12 for shipping, the items would arrive with some kind of coolant. Previous to placing the order I clicked on the Shipping link for detail, and perused the chart that appeared. I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited. So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery. When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it. Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable. Admittedly, it was my mistake not to notice the note on Expedited shipping, however, the response from Euro Food Marts Customer Service lacked objectivity. My rating reflects my entire experience....quality of shipped product and customer service provided by Euro Food Mart. Ive purchased many different Americolor gel colors and am happy with them when they are fresh. I purchased 7 bottles from this TCP vendor and 5 of them were old, one even had a use by date of one year before my order! Working with TCP to get a refund has not been as pleasant as working directly with Amazon. I finally did get a refund but only for the product, not the shipping charges. The products were old and unusable. I am very disappointed with this vendor and will purchase my colorants from another more reliable source. Americolor is good TCP is not. Look at some of the main ingredients: Partially Hydrogenated Canola and Palm Oils.  This stuff may taste sweetly good, but the hydrogenated oils wreak havoc on your body.  Youd be a terrible hostess poisoning guests with this stuff. Well, unless you have very bad guests :P I bought this because the store was out of my brand.  I was disappointed with this coffee.  Not very flavorful, and the flavor is just ok.  Wouldnt buy again. This just did not smell or taste like real olive oil.  And the smoke point was lower than it should have been.  Perhaps it was a bad batch, diluted with some other oil, but Ill never use it again. Long time Keurig user and lifetime coffee drinker.  Breakfast Blend is for the most part a plain cup of coffee.  Light and smooth, but with a slight bitterness at the end.  I still prefer Donut Shop as a light everyday go to coffee choice, but wanted to try a box of Green Mountain BB.  Probably wont purchase again.  No one in the house has stopped me and said, \"thats a great cup of coffee\".  Its just plain and blah.  Ill probably struggle to finish the box honestly. The flavor is not that great.  I would prefer something with a little more flavor,tastes like cheap coffee.  I would not this purchase again. We have ordered this coffee on several occasions and have been happy with the it.  The most recent order seemed lacking in quality.  It was bitter and disappointing. Really weak by my standards, I have to use the smallest volume on the Keurig to get decent flavor. Get extra bold cups instead if you dont like watery coffee. I ordered this coffee under the impression that it was a medium roast,that was according to the brief description & by zooming in the box on my laptop. On the the side of the box it stated medium. When the coffee arrived today it is not medium it is light. No medium on the box at all, just light. I am very disapointed with this purchase as I wanted at least a medium roast flavor. To be able to get a full flavor at all you will need to use a very small amount of water & make a very small cup of coffee. Im sure I could send it back but the hassle is not worth it, but will not buy again. If you like extremely light coffee this is for you, if you like to taste your coffee this is No good. I will order bold from now on. As far as taste there is none unless you make about a 4 oz. cup even then its not very good.Amazon did ship very fast,I received the order sooner than expected & it was packaged very well.Too bad the coffee was not what I ordered/ expected. I dont know if I got a bad batch but this coffee has a nasty plastic flavor. I think the Nantucket Blend is good and the Dark Magic is excellent. My room mate tried it twice and she also thinks the Breakfast Blend is terrible.  Green Mountain makes some very good coffees but in my experience this isnt one of them. I dont like strong coffee but this is so weak and watery, its like drinking...something other than coffee. I tried brewing a small size, using a different size cup, adjusting my cream and sugar, nothing works! Its really disappointing because Ive had other good blends from Green Mountain in the past. Ill stick with Wolfgang Pucks Rodeo Drive or Breakfast In Bed. For anyone liking a weaker coffee,this brand would be fine, but I prefer a stronger coffee so I wouldnt choose this brand again for that reason. Very dissapionted in this oder.Have had this coffee before from another source,but it wasnt avaliable at the time so I odered it thru ammazon.Not the same coffee.Very stale and weak.My hhusband and I both noticed it.Wish I had not order the 50 count but something smaller Having lots of problems with Green Mountain cups. Coffee is fine, but plastic seems heavier than other brands and does not fully drain into cup, but drips considerably when removing to dispose. Will probably choose other brands in the future instead. Have been using K-Cups for over a year and only have had problems with this brand. I switched to Green Mountain Breakfast Blend after not being able to get Black Tiger as a super saver item.  It was a real disappointment.  Very weak and certainly not something I would want as \"breakfast blend\".. Not strong enough for the first cup in the morning.  I need something strong to wake me up. Maybe I should have found a stronger blend Seems very weak.  I must be honest, I ordered the wrong coffee.  I was sad. This isnt bad as a base for an iced coffee. It might just be my preference but I dont like fruit that isnt fully dried out like this. Its very gummy and all taste the same. I see that Dare has decided to cut-down on the filling, the cookies tasted the same, but i like them the way there were.  This was my second order and I was truly disappointed.  I open my box to find broken cookies and cookies that has been in heat and the middle has melted.  The quality was very poor.  I dont know who I should contact for a refund for the broken and melted cookies.  Can you help with this?? If this is not rectified- i will not be ordering any more.  Anybody out there want a box of broken cookies???After making my review, I recieved an e-mail from Amazon, they agreed to refund the cost of my damaged cookies.  I was shocked to see a company with compassion and honesty for their customers....they truly strive to provide good quality customer service.  This is very rare these days, but it is good to know a company out there truly cares.Thank you, I am disappointed since regular wheat thins dont have MSG, but this variety does.  I need to stay away from MSG, since I get migraines.I am sure Nabisco can find a way to make a flavorful cracker without MSG.These crackers have a very strong taste, and I found that the taste stayed in my mouth for a long time.I prefer the original, unflavored wheat things. These crackers taste absolutely delicious, but leave a coating/aftertaste in my mouth that lasts for a long time.  Also, they contain MSG and for some people (Im one of them) it causes a headache.  The last time I binged on these crackers (and they are hard to put down!), I ended up with a crashing headache.  Be forewarned! I had ordered this set thinking it was the decaf sweet ginger peach one served at PF Changes. I was wrong and instead got over 60 bags of strongly caffeinated tea. The shape is great for a teapot, but awkward for a single cup of tea. I would consider this strong coffee, but what is also strong is the smell and taste of cocoa.  I would even say that this is very similar to the flavored coffee (\"cocoa or chocolate\" flavored) I have tried in the past and not a regular blend coffee at all.  As such, I cannot recommend this coffee at all. And wheres the vegetables while your at it? The last 3 or 4 cans of this that Ive had has only had 5 or 6 little bits of beef in them. This last one was mostly carrots. It should have been called \"Carrots in Beef Broth\" Soup. It only had 6 pieces of meat and 5 or 6 little chunks of potato with about 20 pieces of carrots. I usually dump a handful of frozen sweet corn or peas in it and a handful of instant rice to help fill it out. But this time I was out of frozen veggies so I got to see just what ISNT in the soup. Like theres more stuff missing than in it. Once I finish off the cans that I have left I sure aint going to waist any more of my money on it.I scanned and uploaded the ingredients on the label from one of the smaller microwavable cans of the same Chunky Beef Soup. What I have got OUT of the can sure aint like the picture ON the can! Was looking forward to this drink but was put off by its sweet soda-like taste.  Maybe its an acquired taste? Im not sure  but the high calories dont make me want to try.  Looking forward to a diet version. I have tried a couple of the other Switch flavors, and I found them to be very disappointing.  This variety, on the other hand, had excellent Kiwi and Strawberry flavors.  However, I emphasize FLAVORS because that is where the Switch drinks get gimmicky.  They are all marketed under the flavors/juices that appear WAY DOWN on the ingredient listing.  The several varieties that I have tried all have apple and white grape juice as the top ingredients.  This seems like false advertising to me, since those juices are clearly not as appealing.  Anyway, this drink is all about the marketing.  The price you are paying for 8 ounces of carbonated juice is clearly an extravagance, and I wouldnt do it again.  Save yourself some money and visit the juice aisle at the grocery store. Way too heavy on carbonation. What flavors were there were too weak to detect. Sorry, but I wont be buying this one. \"Switch\" advertises itself as \"100% of what you want, 0% of what you dont.\"  While the ingredient list certainly does confirm the particularly natural recipe required to create this beverage, Im afraid I cannot endorse it very highly.  I have long been perturbed by drinks of this nature.  Someone aspiring to consume a more natural beverage with no preservatives or other unpronounceable additives should probably altogether avoid the canned, carbonated-beverage front.  Anyone genuinely interested in eating healthy, regardless of the contents of \"Switch,\" probably wouldnt think twice about purchasing a drink such as this.  Instead, a can of this sort advertises to the hypocritical health nut, who has espoused notions of eating organically as a trend rather than as a genuine lifestyle change.The taste of the beverage itself is par for the course.  There is no added sugar, but its still too sweet.  Its also more than a little too sour, and the fruity nature of it tastes a bit too much like cheap bubble gum.  I also cannot abide the half-hearted attempt at \"carbonation\" that this beverage and others like it undertake; its carbonation that is a little too subtle to taste like anything more than the undercurrent of sour flavors.  Beverages that advertise themselves as \"carbonated\" should commit to the practice as well as the soda-pop industry has or else avoid the practice altogether; anyone truly interested in drinking healthy probably wouldnt be interested in a carbonated beverage anyway.In short, I wouldnt go out of my way to purchase \"Switch.\"  I would drink it at need, when nothing else is available, but I find it to be a contradiction in form and marketing that clearly demonstrates the disingenuous motives of the company that produces it. I suppose the flavor of this carbonated juice could be satisfying to someone, just not me.  If I were thirsty and no other drink was available, I would drink it, but even if I were to like the taste, when I want a drink, I almost always want more than the 8.3 ounces contained in the can.  (Why 8.3 ounces?)  I wonder if the market for this drink is for those who must religiously consume liquids in extreme moderation.  It must be quite hard to come up with a successful new drink product. The Switch Kiwi Berry may be a perfect demonstration of how hard it is.  Better luck next time. The first \"Switch\" carbonated drink I tried from the amazon vine program is the watermelon-strawberry and now, here I am trying the \"kiwi-berry\" flavor. Ive said before that I am not a fan of carbonated drinks and this flavor just reminded me why.Theres no taste of berry nor kiwi in it, and the thing just flat out tastes like carbonated plastic. For a drink claiming to be \"all natural\", no sugar, or preservatives...it sure tastes quite like the opposite. Now I dont know if I just received a defective can, but it isnt it sure didnt quench my thirst and I needed to eat a \"hot pocket\" just to get rid of the odd after taste. Cool packaging, less than good taste.I didnt like it! [2 Stars] This drink left me thirsty, which isnt good when said drink is supposed to quench your thirst.  Its bottle is appetizing, though I found the drink took very little time to finish.  When it comes to taste, it was lacking.  Either the mixture of the Kiwi and Berry was off or something because it reminded me far more of an energy drink than a juice drink.  To its benefit, there was no icky after taste.I will not be switching anytime soon to this drink, but recommend giving it a try, as all our taste buds are different.  Maybe youll like it.  It just wasnt my cup of tea. My husband thought this was alright, but I just couldnt get myself to drink more than a few sips. Let me also add that I am not a soda drinker so this may be a great alternative for someone who is(hence the two stars), but this is an opinion from a non-soda drinker.I had a hard time tasting anything close to Kiwi or berry. It was more cherry or ?? to me. I wouldve liked a little more fizz to it, I consider it just lightly carbonated. Also, I cannot imagine consuming 33grams of sugar in just over 8oz, it tasted WAY to sweet for me.It kind of bothers me to see natural flavors listed in the ingredients too...like what type of natural flavors??? I wouldve hoped all the mixed fruit juices wouldve been enough... I have tried and enjoyed The Switch black cherry flavor, but their kiwi-strawberry left a lot to be desired.  To my palate, the flavor seemed a mix of floral and medicine-y, not very pleasant.  I appreciate the fact that they are trying to push a healthy alternative to soda (basically carbonated water and fruit juice), but they need to get the flavor right. As part of the line of Switch products, Switch Kiwi Berry offers a (slightly) healthier alternative to carbonated soda.  The product is 100% juice, though the majority of the contents are neither kiwi fruit or \"berry\":Ingredients: 100% Juice (Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry and Strawberry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C).Unfortunately, the mix of kiwi and berry flavors in this concoction just does not work for me.  The added kiwi flavor, in particular, imparts a odd sour aftertaste that I just could not get used to.  My children each tried a sip, and for them as well the opinion was mixed.I was pleasantly surprised by the Switch Black Cherry (even though the cherry flavor was a bit weak), but I cant be very enthusiastic about this flavor. While the taste of this \"carbonated juice\", as the manufacturer puts it, is good, there isnt much else to say for this beverage.  One can has 8.3 ounces, which is a bit less than most Americans are used to for a canned drink, but would be a good serving size for kids.  It does have 135 calories, which is a lot, when I could just drink a diet cola for either no calories or one calorie.  Sure, there would be a lot more unnatural additives, but this drink isnt even organic, which many others on the market are.  If I were to spend more money on a healthy and tasty beverage, this would not be my choice. I didnt care for this drink at all.  Its almost like eating a sweettart in liquid, carbonated form.  My husband and oldest daughter felt the same way, but my 13 year old liked it.  It is 100% juice though, which is nice to see in a carbonated beverage. This product label says that it is \"the perfect balance between juice and carbonation\", but I think the maunfacturer still needs to reduce the carbonation further. Also, I tried a couple of other flavors beside this kiwi/berry, and they are all mostly apple, grape, and acerola with a hint of other things. This particular item is called \"Kiwi Berry\", but there is NO kiwi fruit even listed on the ingredient panel. It is true that no corn syrup has been added, but there are still high sugars. For only 8.3 ounces of liquid, we are drinking 135 empty calories;however, this is a high level of vitamin C. Also, children will probably like these really sweet flavors, so this could be an alternative to offer the little ones. <span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 2:06 Mins</span>-1 star for the price!-2 stars for the yucky flavor! enjoy the video! props to my officemate Brendan for filming. This is the second flavor of Switch Ive had and it was... not terribly pleasant. First off, it seemed rather syrupy, but then I realized thats just because the sweetness factor is, apparently, set to eleven. It wasnt actually a struggle to finish it, but it was so cloyingly sweet it makes the average episode of \"Full House\" look like sour, cynical crap. It made me want to reach for insulin, though I dont take any.I suppose this might be a good drink for young children who dont have well-developed palettes, but if youre past the age of, say, nine, this probably isnt the drink for you. Since I love both strawberries and kiwis, I thought this one would be perfect for me. Well, I was wrong. It basically tastes like bubbly fruit punch, not exactly strawberry kiwi. Looking at the ingredients list, it shouldnt surprise.... its a mixture of fruits, kiwi and strawberry being on the bottom of the list.I do recommend the cherry Switch drink, but thats the only one out of three that I liked. This drink would have gotten 4.5 stars from my kids but as an adult, this drink was much too sweet for my husband and myself.  We would never drink anything this cloyingly sweet.  Its made with fruit juice concentrates and flavorings reconstituted with filtered sparkling water.  What Id rather have, and what I make at home frequently, is a normal fruit juice, such as pineapple (no sugar added) and sparkling mineral water.  It cuts the sweetness of the juice, has just enough flavor, a little fizz and is even good for you.  Switch, Im afraid has none of this, its just too sweet and has too much fake flavoring.  We tried the Kiwi Berry and it tasted like overpowering strawberry fake-flavoring, like strawberry flavored candies.  Sorry, Switch, but you could make this simpler and better very easily. The can is pretty, a vibrant carnation pink. But although the can purports to contain 100% juice, a quick inspection reveals that apple and grape, not kiwi and berry (strawberry, raspberry) get top billing on the ingredients list.  Unsurprisingly, the flavor seems a little muddled, a little tangy, awfully sweet.  One family member described it as bubble gummy, another noted that it tasted metallic but \"maybe in a glass bottle it would taste okay.\"As other reviewers have pointed out, this product is heavy on fruit sugars, though I appreciate the absence of that cloying corn syrup sweetener that contaminates so many popular soft drinks.  There is nothing particularly nutritious about Switch, but maybe some parents (presumably the target market) wont be able to figure that out.Its not the worst carbonated beverage Ive ever tried, but its nowhere near the best, nor does it have the fresh wholesome flavor that we spoiled consumers expect from our fruit juices.  Ill stick with water. This soda just did not appeal to me it had a very different taste than soda, (that is probably because I have never a Kiwi Berry Soda before), and it was really over sugared.  The carbanation level of the drink is low.  I think I was expecting this soda to be somewhere inline with Jones Soda.  This would certainly not be an item I would want to purchase again. I have reviewed three different flavors of Switch. This one, the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54\">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E\">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.Of the three flavors by favorite, by far, is the Black Cherry. It had a much more mild taste and didnt seem nearly as sweet as this one. If you like a lot of kick in your juice, and an almost over powering flavor this one may be for you. However, that is not what I was looking for.I much prefer the Black Cherry over the other two. This product is labeled \"100% of what you want\". But one look at the nutrition facts and you may not agree. While it contains 100% juice and vitamin C, no preservatives or sugar, it contains 135 calories, 15 mg of sodium, and a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrates. All this in a tiny 8.3 oz can! I also thought it was too sweet for my tastes, but I normally drink a diet carbonated beverage, so the sweetness did jump out at me. Just okay. I wont add this to my shopping list. I got this drink expecting the carbonated taste combined with kiwi and berries. Well I could taste the berries but no kiwi. I did like the carbonation with real fruit juices without the added sugar but it is not low cal. I think that I liked this drink better than the tangerine drink but still is not for me. The drink is way too sweet for me to enjoy it. My family and I sampled two flavors of Switch -- Kiwi Berry and Watermelon Strawberry.  Though neither is something wed want to purchase, Kiwi Berry was the least desirable of the two.  It tasted like it had way too much sugar, even though the can claims to have no sugar added.  The strawberry flavor was predominant, overwhelming the kiwi almost entirely.  In all, it tasted like strawberry candy.  Even worse -- it had a kind of chemical-y bitterness to it.  If you want a fruity beverage that tastes a lot like candy, go ahead and try Switch.  But if not -- avoid this.  I would especially not want to buy this flavor.  There are better ways to get my daily Vitamin C fix. I really enjoyed the taste of this product. It neither seemed too \"berry\" or too \"kiwi\" -- it was a nice balance. I would compare this to a strongly-flavored carbonated water product. The flavor is clean and crisp, and not overpowering.The product provides 100% of vitamin C -- a definite plus. However, the product has 34g of carbs, 33g of which are sugars. Granted, these are not processed sugars and are only natural sugars from the fruit juices the product contains. However, this results in a product that has 135 calories in an 8.3-ounce can. This results in a poor substitute for soda.Its an all-natural product, and tastes great, but has entirely too many calories for such a small serving. I didnt care for Kiwi Berry Switch. It was very sweet and not refreshing at all. Also, at 135 calories in an 8.3 ounce can, it actually contains a lot more calories than regular soda. I know it is all natural and doesnt have HFC (High Fructose Corn Syrup), and I appreciate that, but it also doesnt have much actual kiwi or berry juices. The drink is VERY sweet, but sweeter than 100% fruit juice, sweeter even than your average can of soda. I cant say I would ever buy this product or recommend it to anyone else. There are better natural sodas on the market, as well as better 100% natural juices. The Switch Kiwi Berry carbonated fruit juice tasted good, but it was too sweet and had too many calories for my liking. I could drink a regular can of soda. Going forward, I probably would not buy this beverage because I do not like to drink that many calories (135) or sugar (33 grams) in one sitting. This drink was sickeningly sweet (and I am a Mountain Dew addict, so I usually have no problem with sweet).  It was much like drinking snow cone flavoring straight from the bottle.  While it is all natural with no added sugar, it still has 140 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  A 16 oz can of Mountain Dew has 170 calories.  Definitely not a \"diet\" drink.  The only way I would recommend it is to keep away from high fructose corn syrup, but even then, at the price, it almost too expensive of an option. The logo says \"100% of what you want.  0% of what you dont want\".  Well, I guess it is who you are talking too.  Even though the Kiwi Berry drink says 100% juice and 0% added sugar it is way too sweet.  The drink is refreshing but if you are thristy this 8.3oz can wont be enough.  The cost is too way expensive to enjoy this drink on a regular basis.  The cute can and unique drink combination doesnt make up for the sweet/tart taste, small skinny can and high price.  Save your money, drink water. I thought this taste good, till about 20 mins after drinking some of the can.Then It kept coming up (burping) yuck! I usually do not burp up my food. I also did not find this very refreshing.With that said, Im not a soda drinker. I drink allot of water, which does not have 135 Calories for 8.3 oz. It says, No surgar added, No preservatives..Believe me, it does not need anymore of a sugar taste..33 Gr. of natural sugar!If your a soda drinker etc. you might find this a better choice. The product description says its \"just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C.\" Doesnt that sound good? I decided to try the Kiwi-Berry flavor, but anyone reading this review should know that The Switch is not the sort of product I buy, and my opinion may be influenced by that fact.The good points: Its got a nice gentle fizz. And yes, its juice, made from concentrates. Sparkling water and apple and grape juice concentrates head the list of ingredients. All natural, which presumably makes it healthier than soda. No added sugar (BUT see below, how could they possibly add any more?) And its fortified with 100% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Not being clear about the term Daily Value (DV), I looked it up and found that its a dietary reference including -- well, lets just say that it includes the information formerly given by the U.S. RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) but you have to do some math.The not-so-good points: Sugar, 33 grams. Carbs, 34 grams. Calories, 135. All that packed into a slim 8 ounce can, not really enough of it to quench much of a thirst. No taste of kiwifruit that I could notice. Not a crisp natural taste, and way too sweet for me. I had to dilute the last third of it with water.I didnt fall in love with The Switch and wont be switching to it. It may have a place as an energy drink, but thats too much sugar for children or for anyone, really. Do yourself a favor: eat an orange and drink a glass of cold filtered water. Youll enjoy it more and your body will thank you.Linda Bulger, 2009 Im sitting here, (Switch) drink in hand, trying to decide how to describe the Switch Kiwi Berry. Its lightly carbonated, which I like but too sweet for my taste (think strawberry candy). The mouth feel is quite round and it has some body too it. Its made from juice concentrates and carbonated water and there are 135 calories of sugar in the small 8 oz can. I wouldnt call it a healthy beverage and whether its natural or not doesnt matter to me. I cant figure out why anyone would want to drink this stuff!? The can is 1/3 less in size than a regular can of soda, its got more sugar and more calories and it doesnt taste very good. Its also a bit expensive for what your getting.......need I say more?......I think not! So how does it taste? Well depends on how sweet you like your drinks. It is tasty but its not as the container would leave you to believe that it is good for you. This is no better then drinking a soda filled with corn syrup because of the amount of calories and carbs it contains. Its all sugar and it shows not only going in but around the mid section if you pounded these things for a few months straight.Pass. I like the concept of these natural, carbonated juice beverages and I really liked the black cherry flavor.  But the Kiwi Berry flavor was too sweet for me.  While the ingredients are only juice and carbonated water, I think that not enough water was added to reconstitute the juice to a good balance.  With 33 grams of sugar in the 8.3 ounce bottle, despite being natural, there is still a lot of sweetness here. This is mostly concentrated apple and grape juice reconstituted with carbonated water; its extremely sweet and more caloric than soda.  Do people who consume this think theyre drinking something healthy, or indulging in liquid candy?  Or is this supposed to be used as a mixer, e.g., for making daiquiris? This has more calories than a regular coke. Even though it says 100% pure juice and no sugar/syrup added, it still tastes so sweet that I couldnt even finish one can.If this werent so sugary tasting, Id like it much more. Flavor-wise its not bad, though. Maybe its only fruit sugar and supposedly fruit sugar isnt as bad for the health, but still... way too sweet for something thats supposed to be \"healthy.\"Maybe little kids would like it as a treat. Probably beats having candy. Switch Kiwi Berry is a soda made from carbonated water and juice concentrates of Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry, Strawberry and mysterious \"natural flavors\". At 135 calories per can, its slightly higher in carbs than an average soda.I gave it two stars because although it is refreshingly free of high fructose corn syrup, it claims to be \"all natural\" -- not sure whats natural about juice concentrate. And, like regular soda, it is chock full of \"empty\" carbs -- like eating raw sugar. I get the feeling from the packaging were supposed to think its a healthier alternative, and this seems disengenious at best.It tastes OK, but really isnt anything special; it doesnt taste like kiwi fruit and only vaguely of strawberries. I was hoping for actual juice. A kiwi and strawberry combination is one of those combinations that I usually love. In fact if you combine strawberry with anything Im usually game (steak, chocolate, banana, etc.) and this COULD be a good drink. However, its in the fizzy drink school of beverages and as a fizzy drink, I cant stand it.Granted, I was never too fond of the fizzy drinks in the first place. The orange drinks were always a bad second to actual orange juice. Not that I dont love pop, but I really cant get behind a bad orange juice pop.So at first taste, this is rather sweet. But then it goes down and its too sweet. And fizzy. The fizzy and the sweet combine and you are drinking candy. Not that pop is anything but candy, but theres candy and theres candy and this is the hard candy that your grandmother gives you to suck on to shut you up for a few hours.Not very good. First off, ordered 2 different types of these Switch drinks and they all literally have the same ingredients, albeit 1 or 2 slight differences. They both begin with : Filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates... What? Not to mention, the first 2 main ingredients are apple and grape-both not the flavour I ordered. Anyway, I rarely read labels to begin with, but for something supposedly 100% juice, I was curious...Ok, now for the taste, or lack thereof. It was slightly fizzy, nothing like full-blown soda, but jeez was it sweet. Like, nasty mediciny sweet. I could not finish the can. I couldnt even taste what flavour it was suppose to be. Thats all there is to it. I am giving it 2 stars because it supposedly has 100% Vitamin C, which is a pretty much the only redeaming quality to this not juice but not soda type drink. The Kiwi Berry drink may not have sugar addded, but it sure tastes sweet. Part of it may be the other fruit jucices mixed in (Apple, Grape, Raspberry, and Strawberry)with more Apple and Grape than Kiwi. For me it was too sweet and did not taste too much like Kiwi fruit. We got this in the mail and were eager to try it.  I am a huge fan of Izze Sparkling Juice and figured this would be similar to that.  It was in regards to taste, however.....well, let me break it down.TASTE: I would give it a four!  It had a slight kick to it, that I love.  A little bit of a bitter taste, which my two older boys seemed to like as well.  In fact my 13 year old was bummed when I said we had finished the can.  My husband enjoyed it as well, though I dont see this replacing his daily Dr. Pepper anytime soon.BENEFIT: It is 100% all natural juice, and it has 100% of your DV of Vitamin C.  Certainly a bit better for you than your traditional soda, but it has just as many calories as a LARGER can of Dr. pepper!  So, i fyou are like me and have maybe one carbonated beverage a day, calorie wise you arent doing yourself any favors by switching to this.  I will stick with my Izze Blackberry.  3 stars.VALUE: 1 1/2 stars, MAYBE 2.  You get 24 8 oz cans for 23 dollars.  Hardly a bargain in todays economic climate.  I like to treat myself occasionally, and a sweet treat is certainly one way I often do that, but 23 dollars for 24 cans of this!  Nope, no way, not happening.Bottom line:  It was tasty, and we enjoyed it, but this isnt something I can see myself buying for my large family.  The benefits just arent there, not when I can get 100% real fruit juice at the store for 3 dollars a gallon, and add a bit of soda water myself for another buck, if that.  Save your money As the title says Im not a fan of fizzy water and that taste definitely comes through in this drink. The tang of this product assaults your mouth right from the first sip.  It smelled nice. But really it was just so sweet and carbonated that the experience was not enjoyable.  There no discernable taste of kiwi or strawberry, just a blast of sugar and bubbles. The 3 people under 11 in our familiy loved it but - as we knew they would.No thanks. The Switch Kiwi Berry,After tasting \"The Switch\" in Black Cherry, I was a little reluctant to even try the Kiwi Berry flavor. At this point my expectations were almost non-existent, mostly because I prefer Black Cherry over the taste of Kiwi. So to be fair, I waited until the following day before trying the Kiwi Berry flavor to allow the taste of the black cherry to be completely gone from my taste buds.I actually found the Kiwi Berry taste to be much more pleasing than the Black Cherry flavor. The carbonation fizz was not as pronounced, disguising that cheap wine cooler flavor. I drank this Kiwi Berry down fairly quickly wanting to saturate my pallet to see if I would once again suffer that bad after-taste.Sure enough, there it was. After careful thought trying to come up with an accurate description on paper of what these drinks taste like to me, what I realized was, if you were to take a glass and fill it half way with a cheap wine cooler and the other half with a warm can of beer that was left over from the previous nights party, you would create the exact same bad after taste I seem to get from drinking either the Black Cherry or Kiwi Berry flavor of the \"Switch\" carbonated fruit juice drinks.Only because the Kiwi Berry flavor tasted great going down, I give this drink a 2 Star rating. The really bad after-taste ruins any chance of further purchases for me. I dont care how healthy something may claim to be, for me to buy it; it has to taste good also. Both during and after you swallow it. Switchs Kiwi Berry drink I found a little on the light side, in many ways.  Only 8.3 ounces with very little in the way of kiwi or strawberry flavoring (the can claims raspberry also and it was MIA also).  The most stand out flavor I could detect was the apple juice, which is the major ingrediant.  While this is 100% juice (from concentrate though) and nicely bubble (I shook mine up prior to drinking, no massive explosion or anything and Im at altitude), Id rather drink something something with either a little more flavor or a little more of it. The initial taste does hint of something, but then the apple and grape juice filler comes to fore and dominates the after- taste.  Comparing this to the Black Cherry drink, Kiwi Berry has a better taste and after taste.  However, if you would have told me that this was the Black Cherry flavor, I would have thought that to be true.  I could not note any significant difference between flavors.  The carbonation offers no benefit in the taste or feel category.  The price is high - about $1 per 8 oz can.  If I want juice, Ill stick with real juice without the carbonation. Overly sweet w/ a slight fizzy touch on the tongue. My husband and 4 year old appeared to like it, but overall I could barely take a couple of gulps.It reminded me too much like candy.I would not recommend this item personally, but some may find the drink enjoyable w/ the combination of juice and carbonate. This used to be a good product before they started watering it down, which is why I quit buying it. Bought this with my last bit of money so I could eat for a couple weeks..I assumed this would taste pretty good, because I like canned foods pretty well(as well as someone can like canned foods)... but Chef Boyardee is dreadful when you compare it to generic brands. Walmart brand and stuff that I buy at Save-A-Lot tastes WAY better than this. I had to water down the sauce just to be able to eat it.. It was just... nasty.It did save me from starvation, and one can lasted me all day.. so I cant fault it too much. However, save your money. Buy the cheaper generic brands. They taste way better, and theres more raviolis in a can - even if they arent \"overstuffed\". The coffee pods are convenient but the quality of the coffee is not good (you will find this especially if you are used to using a grinder, fresh beans etc). Im not sure if this is due to the pod itself or the machine in terms of temperature, pressure. I suspect the problem lies with the pod technology and the coffee within. Im going back to a grinder, fresh beans and a traditional machine. My son had a constipation problem when he was around 13 months.  He tried this at a family members house and loved it.  It also helped with the constipation.  So I ordered a pack and he really did not seem interested.  Mango juice works great for constipation if your kids like the taste. Theres an old saying that a bargain is not a bargain if there is no use for the item. While the price of this made it seem a very attractive; it goes to waste since the cats do not eat it. Dunno where the alleged 6 Pack went. I received ONE 2lb box of biscuits.  Dont be misguided by false advertising.  On another IAMS order from another supplier received what I had ordered. Be careful of size description here - listed as .1 oz. jars when clearly the jar itself says .01 ounce. That is a HUGE difference. Shop around - you can find saffron from several retailers for $85-$95 per ounce, thus making this .03 total ounces valued at $2.70. I know this is an awesome spice at a ridiculous price (no matter where you order it from), but a diligent consumer will save alot. It will also be beneficial to learn what to look for in high quality saffron vs. low quality. Happy surfing! This was my favorite candy as a child; thus, I remember it well. The present product isnt the same. The flavor is very artificial, in comparison to the rich vanilla taste that the original had. Todays manufacturer is likely using a lot of cheap, synthetic flavors, synthetic components, and a rapid manufacturing turnover process, all of which make it the end result inferior to the original.Those hoping for the real thing will have to continue hoping. New tasters will wonder what the [harsh artificial tasting] fuss is all about. Im going to have to go against everyone elses reviews here so far, because I found this rice to be both dry and very bland. Its certainly not delicious, and I was extremely disappointed, particularly because I bought it on the strength of the other reviews here.For those curious, I made this in my Zojirushi (made in Japan) rice cooker, which makes perfect rice every time.On the plus side, it certainly is healthy, and other people seem to like it, but I didnt at all. I love coconut but this bar is a disappointment.  The first bite had an odd flavor but after a couple more it got a bit better.  The problem is that its very oily, they put way too much rice syrup and its literally juicy with oil when you bite into it.  At 246 calories, 14g fat 33g carbs and 29g sugar, this bar is not worth it at all. The concept is good. I love the plain/original Oskri coconut bars. They have a nice texture. I like Mounds and wanted a slightly healthier version. These could be that, but this box was way below quality. It seems like it is old because most of the bars I have tried have discolored chocolate and the coconut is dried out. One of the bars even had a bad seal so that I didnt even have to rip it open and it was completely dried out. The plain bars are not dry at all, so these really did not meet the standards I was expecting. Wont buy these again, but that is probably best because the sugar content is high, even though it is superior to corn syrup. I dont understand why the flavors included in this variety pack are not listed in the Product Features section, just below the photo.  One has to read down PAST the legal disclaimers to find what flavors are included.  And even once one gets to the Product Features section which reveals the included flavors, one must first get past the hype:Product DescriptionEvery refreshing variety lets you add flavor to you water without adding calories. These are great for bottle water. Comes with 4 flavors; Wild Strawberry, Raspberry Lemonade, Natural Lemonade, and Cherry PomegranateDespite the concerns that Aspartame is not harmless, I do drink a lot of Crystal Light.  Sugar is not harmless either, for some of us.  I cant afford the sugar and calories in real fruit juices as a beverage choice more than once a day.Crystal Light \"Natural\" Leomonade flavor is delicious.  What I dont understand is why all of the other flavors have a bad aftertaste.  I suppose it must have something to do with the  tartness of the lemon-like flavor that disguises it.\"Natural\" Lemonade: aside from the ridiculous use of one of big fake foods favorite BS terms, \"natural\" (good grief, just look at the ingredients list!), this, for my taste, is the best Crystal Light flavor.  Though its not what most people would consider natural, it does \"taste\" remarkably like real lemonade. However, I do use nearly twice the amount of powder and loads of crushed ice to get that taste.Raspberry Lemonade: Artificial tasting, slight bad aftertaste, you can improve this by adding half a real squeezed lemon. This used to taste better, but about a year ago it changed.  It still has less of the aftertaste than most of the other flavors.Wild Strawberry: Too fake tasting and terrible, strong, bitter, fake sugar aftertaste.  Almost as bad  as saccharine.Cherry Pomegranate: dittoMy final complaint is the cost. I think theres a good deal of corporate greed involved here. I imagine the profit margin is astronomical. (Yeah, I know, I dont \"have\" to buy it.  They dont \"have\" to be greedy ba$t@rd$ either.) I love yoo-hoo.  its one of my favorite gas station buys...meaning, i dont buy it from the store, but if im going on a trip or something, ill pick up a yoo-hoo.I was super surprised to find this drink mix.  It was cheap and I thought the kids and i would like making our own yoo-hoo at home.  i was totally disappointed.  it does not taste like yoo-hoo. it tastes nasty.  almost too sweet?  and it doesnt dissolve well in milk.  you can stir and stir, and you still have nasty clumps floating on the top of your milk.i did give it two stars because...well, its drinkable.  and my kids kind of like it. WHY, OH WHY would Gluten Free Pantry mess with a great thing? The reviews of this product are ALL from pre-recipe change. I wonder what everyone thinks now that the recipe has changed. The FIRST ingredient in these brownies used to be DUTCH COCOA and OH, were they decadent! But NOW, they dont stand out above any other mix out there. They are just \"okay\", where they used to be FAR superior, heads and shoulders above the competition! Im extremely disappointed. They taste so BLAH now. I wont be buying them anymore. I bought the six pack case and after baking the first two boxes I am confident that I wont be purchasing this again. If you are looking for chocolate decadence, you wont find it here. The next box I will try with regular oil not melted butter/margarine as directed. Maybe then Ill get that chewy, gooey richness that this products claims. There is a strange aftertaste, not one that I wish to linger. Betty Crocker G/F brownie mix is by far a better tasting brownie and less expensive. My vote is G/F with Betty C! This brownie mix came to us in a gift box and we loved them so we bought a case.  Since then we have problems with them.  Are they supposed to be oily and come out bubbly and liquidy? i dont remember them doing that the first time. Its like they separate- baked on the edges and goo in the middle- and it doesnt matter how long they are baked.  We still eat them but i wonder if theres something wrong or if were doing something wrong?!! This mat is worthless. It is tiny and doesnt stay put so the cat still gets litter every where. Like others said the mat is uncomfortable and the cat just jumps over it. So instead of having litter right in front of the box, she tracks it all over the room. Dont buy! When I bought this mat I initially thought it was fine but it actuality is too small and at the beginning my cats didnt like stepping on it either.  Because of it small size, I end up with daily litter on either side of this mat.  Disappointed and now looking for a replacement that catches more of the litter. Cute, inexpensive litter mat.  However, the side curled up and will not flatten down, plus it will not stay in place on our Linoleum floor. This product is very cute - I have it in the tan color and the cat graphic is nice. However, it does not cover enough square footage. The narrow end is particularly troublesome. However, it is durable - mine has lasted for two years. Yet because of the mess that inevitably winds up near the mat but not on the mat (because the mat is too small), I will be replacing this item.Additionally, if you are neat freak, you probably wont like this item because certain debris can become tightly lodged in the prongs of this mat - you can clean it with a power hose outdoors, but that will be a pain to do every few days. Just a paper towel and/or a dust pan are not sufficient to thoroughly clean this item. Needs to be at least twice the size it is to be effective. When the cats did manage to step on it after leaving the box it did a good job of collecting litter that I could dump back into the litter box. The thick plastic that this mat is made of is really easy to clean, as you can just vacuum up any excess litter.  Some cats may not like the pointed surface of the mat; my cat doesnt seem to mind.  The main problem is that the mat is so small that most of the time my cat ends up exiting from a different side of the litter box, and thus the mat doesnt do any good.  Im looking to purchase a different mat, because the small size of this one renders it all but useless. This mat is just fine... by me. My cat, on the other hand, avoids it like the plague. It must feel funny to her little toes. I dont think she has stepped on it a single time. Her entire room will be littered with litter (sorry, couldnt resist), but this mat will remain perfectly clean, because she avoids it so religiously. I find myself wondering why I keep using it. I really should just throw it out.Im sure there are cats out there who might not mind. But, for my cat, this was a no go. This mat is so small, and as others have noted, the \"turf\" is pointy - so it probably hurts cats paws (it hurts my knees!)  My cat jumps right over it and I end up with litter kicked up all over the place.  Seems like a good concept, but I would bet it doesnt solve most peoples problem of trying to contain the litter.I just bought an extra large Petmate Litter Catcher that has 4-1/2 stars.  Hopefully, Ill have more success with that! Inexpensive little mat. But its so small and doesnt help when my cat kicks litter out of anywhere other than right in front of the box. And like others have written its got little spokes poking out so my cat didnt even like to step on it so it made even more of a mess. It needed to be cleaned daily and it was just overall more hassle than the small price tag. I have older mats that have a ribbed surface and work great. These have small stiff points and actually hurt to lean on or kneel on. I can imagine that they hurt my cats paws ad that is why they tend to jump over them when exiting the littler box. I ordered this product for my wife who remembered these things from childhood. Originally she wanted some Circus Peanuts, but upon seeing this product, she remembered the enjoyment she had as a child. At any rate, the Brachs Chicks & Rabbits was $9.99 for a 10.5 ounce package. I thought this was a little pricy, and could not easily determine how big of a package this actually was, but bought it anyway.We got the candy after a few days with Amazon Prime, but when it came, I was thoroughly disappointed. The package (not shipping material, but actual bag of candy) was in battered condition, but not being punctured, we kept it. The candy itself was very stale - and exactly like Circus Peanuts candy (just a different shape/color).In short, go for the $1.00 package of circus peanuts before spending $10 on this. My recommendation is to buy this product for nostalgia, not enjoyment. I was looking for a non-peanut mixed nut that was pre-packaged in a small quantity for taking to work as part of lunch or for a snack.Overall, this met the criteria, but there were problems because they used walnuts. Walnuts are less stable and go rancid faster than other nuts typically used in \"mixed nuts\". So, after the first few encounters with bad walnuts, I just began avoiding the walnuts. The mix would work better with pecans instead of walnuts. They hold up better.Im not likely to buy this again I have ordered this blend several times & liked it.This shipment was bitter. Maybe it was just a bad batch or maybe old. After buying my Keurig, Ive done a bit of experimenting with different varieties of coffees available.  Ive enjoyed other Newmans Own products, so this one caught my eye.  I was disappointed.  Im not sure how they came up with \"Extra Bold\" in the name, but I found it relatively weak.  I ended up drinking a couple, saving one or two for potential guests that might like weaker, smoother blends and gave the rest away. My standard for a good cup would be Green Mountains Extra Bold Expresso which has been hard to find for around sixty cents or less a serving so I tried this brand after my friend gave me a cup at the office. My batch was a lot weaker. Not sure if the coffee content was less than my friends batch, but I ended up packing my own Expresso coffee in the K-cup which filled the bill.George S.Oceanside NY i like a darker roast i guess. Its ok, prob would not buy again. i brew it on the middle selection on the keurig, not the full cup. There is nothing \"extra bold,\" or even \"regular bold\" about this coffee.  On the other hand, if you like your coffee meek and weak, you may well like this.  This comment isnt meant to suggest that my tastes are superior, Im just stating that this is not \"extra bold\" at all.  If you want your coffee \"slap your face\" strong, try another Green Mountain flavor.  Dark magic, for example. I have tried quite a few K-Cup products and this one left me longing for something else. It kind of has a burnt taste to it. I have tried Newmans coffee via a McDonalds and it did not taste like this. Overall I was disappointed and have moved on to the likes of Wolfgang Puck. These tend to be a little more smooth. Green Mountain keeps changing the wording on their Amazon description and box for this coffee, and this led me to mistakenly buy it for the third time.  I expect products labeled with the Newmans Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).  They advertise it as being a medium roast, and its not.  When you look at the package it says regular medium roast and extra bold.  How can it be all three?  I like my coffee strong, but not burned (think regular Starbucks) or bitter, and this coffee is both.  I love other bold brands like Deidrichs French roast, but really dont like this coffee. If you are a fan of regular Starbucks youll like this stuff. I bought this tea at Stop and Shop and it clearly has warnings on it but I didnt expect it to cause like a panic attack or something uncomfortable like my heart to beat loudly as it was audible. I dont fancy the flavor of this tea.  Yogi makes a sampler with this one in it. I bought this (herbal) tea for relief from (a couple months of) breathing issues. Thinking that I may have asthma (Ive never been diagnosed). At first it was grand, helping my cough, soothing to my throat and chest. Then surprisingly my stomach started to gurgle and I was frequenting the loo, stopped taking things were fine. Finally, last night I tried nettle (2 caps) and some ginger with honey added tea..ahh relief, sleep! Tonight I will try angelica root and see if that helps. i wanted something that had enough meat so my mini schnauzer would want to bite on it however i needed something that could entice him to chew on this rather than my apartment. THis bone was not the solution. There is practically no meat on this bone and after two minutes of chewing he lost interest in it. I threw it away after the first week snce he never touched it again. I was very disapointed with this item.It does not look like the photo shown,In fact when it came I thought they had made a mistake.The only (good?)thing about this thing is it is indestructable.Make sure it is put away after it has been chewed? on,hitting your toes on this in the middle of the night might cause you to throw it across a room. For those who are looking to avoid soy, this product contains soy lecithin which is not listed in the product ingredients in the Amazon description.  The candy packaging does not indicate \"organic non-GMO soy\" so it likely derives from (as does most soy) genetically modified sources. Soy lecithin is a waste product created when crude soybean oil is \"degummed\". After some searching, found some outstanding chocolate with no soy lecithin - Alter Eco.  This chocolate has a variety of flavors - midnight crunch with quinoa, dark chocolate mint, cacao, etc .  I have tried all three and they are excellent.  I do not think they have a coconut - which is why I bought the Oskri.  Alter Eco is USDA organic, fair trade, vegan, gluten free, soy and GMO free, no chemicals at all, no emulsifies.  Very good - should not be this hard to find food that is pure, simple and has no nasty additives.  Oh,before I read the fine print on the wrapper, I did try this, good flavor, fairly tough and chewy consistency but not bad flavor. First, Ill give the manufacturer some credit for making a no-additive, sucralose-only product. The problem with this product is: its just too weak, in flavor that is. 1 gram of this \"pure sucralose\" tastes about as strong as 1 gram of a Splenda packet, for comparison.If you dont mind spending a lot for a little bit of pure sucralose taste, then maybe this is for you, but cost-conscious customers might want to look elsewhere for a no-carb, non-calorie sweetener. This coffee was extremely weak and did not taste well. I do not recommend wasting your money on it. I had been using Green Mountain MILK Hot Chocolate, which is good (my kids love it), but weak for a true chocoholic like myself. I thought since I like dark chocolate in general, I would try the DARK Hot Chocolate. Thankfully, I only bought a small quantity because it has a really nasty after taste to it that lingers. Im going to stick with my weak milk hot chocolate and just make a smaller cup. My baby likes it but I think its too much sugar. Its made from concentrate, so it tastes artificial. Try fruitables instead. It has vegetable and fruit juices, less sugar, and tastes much better. Good price on Amazon. What I like about wafers is the lightweight effect. Thought these would be similar to Manner wafers, with many exceedingly thin layers, however they are very different. The three wafers per piece are thick and crunchy rather than lightweight and paper-thin. In addition, the filling is scant and dry. The wafers lose their crispness very quickly when exposed to air, so must be eaten immediately upon opening. Given that these wafers have ingredients similar to those of the Manner competitor, they are overpriced and inferior in taste and texture. Other household members dont like them either, so I will have to give them away. Will not buy again. I decided to purchase this product based on a blog by one of thesupplement oriented doctors on the internet, hyping erythritol assuperior to xylitol, which I use regularly and find the closestto sugar in taste with almost no aftertaste and no side effectsto my knowledge.  The problem I find with erythritol is its lackof flavor.  On cereal, I barely notice any real sweetness, evenwhen I put as much as a tablespoon and a half on a normal sizebowl.  When I use Ideal, the name of the xylitol brand I use, ithas the same sweetness as sugar in the same proportion.  Dont getme wrong, erythritol isnt unpleasant, it just has very littlesweetness relative to how much you use.  Not worth the price unlessyou want just a hint of sweetness compared to what you get withsugar or xylitol. I bought this expecting the \"powdered\" form as it specified and ended up paying for a product I cannot use. The two, granulated(which this IS) and powdered(which it clearly is NOT) are NOT interchangeable within recipes. I felt like I was tricked into buying the wrong product! GROSS. Tastes like salty menthol sugar or something. Might be passable if youre hiding it in something youre baking...but for coffee? NAH. If you dont own a dog, use Xylitol, because Xylitol will kill your dog. If you do own a dog, just be a man and either quit sweeteners all together, or enjoy sugar. Unless you have diabetes, the truth is that most of you will try this sweetener, that sweetener, and eventually end up back at sugar. Sugar CRUSHES Erythritol. This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesnt have quite as much flavor either.  It didnt pass muster with my kids, so I probably wont buy it again. The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy. This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste. were used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two. Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was$3-4 less at Target. If youre impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Dont get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping). The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor. While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice. I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help. The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again. I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients. Awesome dog food. However, when given to my \"Boston\", who has severe reactions to some food ingredients; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night, scratching. As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped. So glad Natural Balance has other choices. I guess you have to try each, until you find whats best for your pet. not what I was expecting in terms of the companys reputation for excellent home delivery products I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesnt go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon. I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same. These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. Theyre kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so thats where the three stars come from. I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace. The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me. The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller. Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great. The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope. WE have been looking for \"natural\" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule. Yes, wed probably be better served taking a yoga class, but this is a good second choice. This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me. After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome. The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright.  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably wont get this again.  There is just a slight \"vitaminy\" taste, but its not overwhelming.  Its also a bit pricey for what you get. Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day, as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE!!! LOLOLOL!!! My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us. It definitely makes you sweat a bit when youre eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I dont think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormicks brand of Fajita mix. Ive also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasnt as spicy as this mix is.If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and its versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I dont think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.I have one more package of this to use and next time Im going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more. The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem. I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years, after being introduced to it in a Starbucks. My most recent purchase, however, was disappointing. The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a \"1\" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a \"51A\"). Bottom line: their current product is not much better than much cheaper products. When they get a better crop, Ill go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw. I thought this was a great buy, but as noted by Scott D., the molasses content was not up to par.  I loved the higher molasses content \"Sugar in the Raw\".  Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags.  I guess Ill watch for the next crop. howdy yall,the actual product is VERY good - id rate the item a 4 on its own. however, its only ONE dollar at the local grocery and - @ twenty eight+ dollars per twelve pack - these are running almost two and a half dollars each.as i said, TOO EXPENSIVE. [*sigh ...*] i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost.take care,lee Nothing wrong with the product, but I sure had to mix it with *lots* of other ingredients to make it edible to me. (In Texas I was called a \"baby-mouth\" - not into very spicy-hot foods.)For comparison, Im comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel, mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes, was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips. I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though. I am a energy junkie and Im not sure if this works or not, but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest. I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results. I like this products because it is  more natural then the others. I purchased it because it was on sale. In terms of the energy it provides, it works, but the taste leaves something to be desired. I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable. I was amazed at how quickly it arrived!  It is a cute stocking stuffer, but only OK as far as user appeal.  You get what you pay for. Toy was typical quality I expected.  I got taken for a major ride on the shipping! This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned.  I couldnt get the food pieces out to save my life. I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests. I love, love, love the idea of this product and my little one loves, loves, loves to use it.  She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I dont have to worry about her choking.  The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.  Granted, some foods are more difficult than others and some dont cause that much of a problem.  Bananas however, have pretty much destroyed a couple of them.  While I love this product, I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags. The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product, its kind of like sucking on food through a cloth. While my daughter was interested in it for a little while, she eventually lost interest. I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts. The spicy version of this ketchup isnt bad, but it is too expensive.  The regular version is sweet as dessert.  Horrible.  Annies Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less.  Even Heinz organic is a better deal.  I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass, not plastic. I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess. Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product. Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... Im not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. Id give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didnt leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.Id give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips. I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste. OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, Im in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I cant live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.I havent tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :) I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again. This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  Ill stick with the salt and black pepper chips. These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulders Salt and Malt Vinegar chips.  THOSE are awesome. These things are just too darn cheesy. If you like a lot of flavor, youll love these. Otherwise, you will overdose on their cheddary goodness. These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces. also felt very greasy. Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin. The first time I tried these, I thought, \"WOW!\" but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart... Hard to enjoy the potato-chippiness of them when your mouth is under seige. These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.  Theyre not necessarily bad but theyre the kind of chip where youre only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty. These are better in England. I dont know why. Maybe its just nostalgia on my part. I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt.  However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August.  I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips.  I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable!  How convenient!  Although I love this chips, I wont order from here again with the concern of close expiration date... I dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did. I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me !!! These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a \"low salt\" item.  They seem as salty as any \"regular\" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy. Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes \"too much\". And certainly isnt good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.AND the package cant be opened without a sharp implement. I couldnt pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I dont normally carry a knife or scissors and dont have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.On the package it says these are \"Krinkle Cut\" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I dont eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.These are good but so are other brands with which I dont have these problems. Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  Im not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickies are better IMHO. I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? Whats wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lays texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish theyd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though. These were not flavorful enough for my taste. It seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag. Too bad, because I really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip. I would not buy these again. Expiration date 1-13. Smashed and. stale. edible, not real enjoyable for the price I paid, One of the best pretzels I had wheni purchased them from Publix. They stopped carrying them, I must find another addiction. This product is made by Annies Inc. in Berkely, CA--made in the USA.  The product maintains excellent organic integrity, and it is stored in 100% recycled paperboard packaging.The manufacturers also support family farms - use organic milk, butter, and yogurt.  The product takes approximately 10 min. to prepare.  The product contains dairy and wheat, and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy products.The ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta, organic valley organic cheddar cheese (organic cultured pasteurized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), organic whey, salt, and sodium phosphate.This is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni & cheese dinner.  This mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food.  The pasta is firm, and it has an excellent flavor.There are no artificial flavors, synthetics colors, or preservatives.  The pasta was produced without antibiotics, synthetic hormones, or persistent pesticides.This pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture.  There are 2.5 servings per box (2.5 oz).  Each serving contains 250 cal., 4.5 g fat, sat. 2 g fat, 10 mg cholest., 570 mg sodium, 43 g carb., 5 g fiber, 6 g sugars, 9 g protein.However, the cheese envelop is not exactly sufficient even when you add the butter, milk, or yogurt.  To add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese, you will have to add your own organic cheese.The cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta.  I give this mac and cheese a 5/5 on packaging, 5/5 for maintain organic integrity, 5/5 on texture, and a 2/5 for flavor. This coffee is good but, for me, its nothing special. I will buy it again because its a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, its taking a long time to be delivered (still havent gotten it).The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this \"Kona coffee\" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and theres a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So its my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasnt careful. Ive bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And dont expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it. Bought this at a local specialty-item store because I adore chutney.  Because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item I wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket.  Wrong.  It is mostly gel (jelly) with a few fruits sprinkled throughout and tastes like cheap thickened jelly you put on sandwiches...Ive had much better and thats just talking about the supermarket brands.  Very disappointed.  Money does not buy quality. I was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken. I couldnt send it back as i needed for a project. Of course, we all know how delicious Ghirardelli chocolate is!!!! Unfortunately, after I purchased two of these gift bags online, I found them in a local store for half the price. Lesson learned???!!! Are people really paying 10 bucks for these chocolates??? ummmm go to any grocery store and by them for 2.98 a bag..wow This was really a disappointment. While the products included are fine, the real disappointment was the travel mug. It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it! So it is basically just a cookie package! Yeah, that is really what I want to use as a travel mug. I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store. The product description says the polka dot tumbler is \"definitely a keeper.\" What? It is simply cheap packaging! Not something of quality to enjoy. Had I known that I would not have purchased the set. I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis. I like the products inside and the basket is OK, but really this what not what it appeared to be. It looks pretty, but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality. Theres a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store. The basket is nice, though. Besides that mentioned in the title, the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat, the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin (for those of you that have tasted them), and taste lasts for not very long.  Id say, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3.  Also, the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time. The taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of Yunnan. It is ok to drink, but not to really enjoy. I only make it for when I am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway. To my mind, a fine caramel should be creamy and melting.  These are grainy.  The flavor on these was fine, although a little sweet to my taste. If you are concerned with an aluminum free product, then this is the product for you.  Too bad that baking SODA does not in any form contain aluminum.  This is, however a concern for baking POWDER which can, depending on manufacturer, contain aluminum.  Save your hard earned money and buy Bobs Red Mill regular baking soda.  Arm & Hammer is great for general cleaning purposes, but for natural beauty and health care, this brand is perfect.Just thought youd all like to know. I almost fell for it myself until I did a little digging around. :)P.S- So as not to let all of amazon.com-land feel I am one of those \"haters who dont really know what theyre talking about\", I LOVE Bobs Red Mill Co. and shall continue purchasing their excellent products. The chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother. The product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting Japan. They are OK, but my husband only eats them when we are in car. We keep them there for a celiac snack. (Hard to find when roaming around.) He wont eat them otherwise. They are definitely raspberry, but are kind of dry.  We have never tried any other snack bars, so in all honesty they may be the norm. I dont know.  We DO like Enjoy Lifes other products.  They are GF, have no MSG or related products or aspartates. Both our twins love this one right from the start but its not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now theyre 10 months.  Im glad they are eating something green because we couldnt get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months, but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 months.Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and weve also tried sweet potato with cinnamon. They love all the fruit varieties.Im glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein, although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredients.This one also has carrots and Ive heard all babies like carrots.  I dont know if they would like it without the carrots.  I havent seen this one - lentils and brown rice - in our local stores, so Im glad to get it here. Along with some others, we get this one with the subscription.  Of course, with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and were so busy that its great to get these delivered.The packaging is excellent.  Ive ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken.Ingredients per label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil.This has 70 calories, 10% protein, 100% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron.Im informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult. I liked getting this one for my twin 10-month olds because it has such interesting ingredients, particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans.  I like the fact that its vegetarian yet I believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice.  This list of ingredients looks excellent and its a green color naturally.The babies liked it.  They have liked everything that has carrots.I have the subscription for this one as I really like the ingredients and the fact that Im giving the babies food that is naturally green.Ingredients per the label: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.This has 70 calories, 8% protein, 40% vitamin A, 10% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 2% iron.  Ive been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult. Earths Best Turkey Vegetable Dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey. You can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level.  I just cant find non-sweetened and non-dried cranberries even at the better food stores.Apples, carrots and turkey taste good to my 10-month old growing twin girls.  Babies love carrots since theyre sweet to their taste, so that made a great addition.  The whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistency.The ingredients per the label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, mechanically separated organic turkey, organic whole barley flour.In addition to 12% protein and 50% vitamin A, it has 6% calcium and 4% iron.Im very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through Earths Best.  Ive been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult. Would be a quality product if it werent so thin. Nearly the consistency of soup. It just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be. My baby LOVES sweet potatoes. I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there... it was horribly runny, like spooning formula into his mouth. Ick. I introduced my daughter to Earths Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months. A bit early, but shes advanced, as she was 6 weeks overdue.  She loved it at first.  But, I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite.  Ive tried some of it as well.  Of all of them, this is also my least favorite. We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors. I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein. Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes. This one is more watery than the others, so keep that in mind. Reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different, so I hope letting you know the consistency and texture help. I purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that I paid 3 times more than what I should be. $13.95 for 4 cans is highway robbery now that I know that I can purchase one can for around $1.09. Now as far as the item itself, this brand of Panang Paste is excellent. The beef panang dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the Thai restaurant. I would recommend the paste but not the price. These little animal crackers taste good & my doggies like them, but I wont be buying again. They are like the human animal crackers & have flour & sugar & other bad stuff for dogs. I will continue to buy the healthy treats for my doggies which they also love without sugar. You might want to try Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Natural Balance, Zukes, just to name a few. The smell at first was just like a bed of fresh roses. Even though the rose content is very minimal I found the smell overwhelming. I did not like that this brand of spices does not have a seal in place and only a loosely screwed on lid. There is no shaker lid either. You open it and it dumps. I am questioning how only a few minute pieces of roses could produce such a perfume odor. I hope it is not chemically enhanced. With the lid being loose and not sealed I have doubts about the safety of the product. I was hoping these were more true caramels, not caramel-flavored truffles, but theyre still delicious. Would definitely order them again, and maybe extra for gifts. The salt just makes them extra amazing.Bummer about the shipping-- shipping on this item is reasonable, but we bought the chocolate covered pretzels at the same time, and shipping was charged for both items even though they arrived in the same box. There wasnt even anything fancy about the packaging!edit: okay, these actually bother my stomach a little after one truffle. the package wasnt shipped with an ingredients list, and i had to go to the company site directly and find a well-hidden and hard to follow ingredients page to discover theres a lot of shady ingredients, including high fructose corn syrup. For $40 a box, I expect NO CORN SYRUP. I also dont expect propylene glycol (antifreeze) in vanilla, which I expect to be 100% vanilla beans, and NOT artificial vanillin (which sometimes comes from the anal glands of beavers). Im disappointed in the ingredient quality.http://www.premiumchocolatiers.com/ingredient_info.phpReview goes from 5 stars to 3. Id make it 2, but the extra star is because they ARE quite delicious. I really like the Mueslix cereal, but the Amazon price is awful.$22.73 for a 5 pack is over $4.50 a box.This product RETAILS in the stores here for around $4 a box (Publix, Kroger, Ingles).So the Amazon price is higher than retail.Mueslix is almost never on sale though, unlike other Kelloggs cereals.1-2 times per year, Publix grocery has all Kelloggs cereals for half price.$2/box is an incredible price and we stock up for the next several weeks.I expected the Amazon price to be more like $3/box, since it was a 5 pack.But boy was I wrong. i bought the liter size bottles of this dressing on Amazon, so i am assuming they are the same since they have the same name and the nutritional facts are identical. This dressing is definitely too sweet for my taste. My wife agrees. Otherwise very good. I use it on tossed salads only. I was expecting to receive only Starburst. When I received this it was half Skittles which I did not want or need.  I needed only Starburst.  Next time I will just go to the store. Its a good idea to have raw sugar type cubes, but this was 3x the cost of granulated raw sugar This does not reflect on the product but my shi-tzus took them and left them laying on the carpet. Normally with chicken or turkey snacks, they go nuts.I donated both containers to the Humane Society. Id try a smaller quantity for a first order. I originally ordered two teas from Art of Tea - the Silver Needles and the Coconut Creme. When my package came in, they had shipped the Coconut Creme and mistakenly bundled it with this Mandarin Silk tea by accident. I contacted Amazon and they refunded the Silver Needles and told me I could \"dispose of the Mandarin Silk Oolong as I saw fit.\" Well, since Im never one to turn down tea, I chose to dispose of it by, well, drinking it.This isnt a bad tea, first off. I dont have too much experience with oolongs, but I do like the flavor of this. However, I dont taste too much of the mandarin. It almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea, and it has a similar light green/yellow color. I drink it with a little honey.All in all, its a decent tea. I dont think Ill order it again, but Ill certainly finish off this tin. 4 bags of chips were open when I received the shipment. I am hoping that the chips wereblew open during shipment in flight.  No more chips for me through Amazon.  Otherwise,the chips are good to eat and very salty. The Uncle Rays BBQ Potato Chips are comparable to Lays or most commonly available chips in local markets.  The BBQ spice ia a bit too much; the one pound bags consisted of about half broken chips.  I wont think about buying these again, even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip. Just in case, if anyone doesnt know what WHITE tea is, as opposed to green or black, lets quote Wikipedia: \"white tea is fast-dried, while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan (while kept moving for even curing). Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing.\" What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, its overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.This particular product, while it comes in tea bags, its not exactly your supermarket variety. Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the Choice brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder.This being a white tea, delicate and subtle and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet, green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If its not love at the first sip, give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not.INGREDIENTS:- organic, fair trade certified White Tea- natural Lychee flavor- organic Osmanthus flavor- contains caffeineThe somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer. Time will tell but at this time 3 stars (meaning its Okay) seem to be the fair rating. As the ingredients contained in this food are not the optimal food sources essential to a cats well being, I dont actually feed my cats this dry food.Corn is the first ingredient, which is a food my cats really dont crave.  There is a meat source as the second ingredient, but unfortunately, it is a by-product.  Although there are a couple of other meat sources listed in the ingredients, the addition of artificial preservatives and coloring make this cat food a less than desirable food staple for any cat.However, the Amazon price is good and with Amazon prime 2-day free shipping directly to work, this is a very convenient food for the shop cats I feed.  While the ingredients arent the best, feeding it along with canned food, it is a balanced diet and seems to keep the shop cats healthy. This tea is a new flavor of black tea by Tazo. Its better than some other brands but not even close to beIng as good as their old flavor of black tea with citrus (which they took off the market). I dont think this tea is worth sending away for because you can buy it locally in most grocery stores. After searching for a more constant and less expensive supply of \"real\" licorice over my favorite (more about that later), I decided to try this one based upon other reviews and the description. I have to say that I was disappointed. It is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that I noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which I would charactize as \"modest\". My all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a St. Louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by Bissingers Chocolate Company and they call it French Long Licorice. It is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky-sweet candy. I say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite \"type\" of licorice; this is important when reading reviews and purchasing. I was looking for something not American-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones.As far a Bissingers is concerned, they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production. It is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability (I can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if I dont chew). These are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and I limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my \"fix\"; okay, sometimes 3 if it is a superb book:D.The last time I ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank-you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because I do not live near one of their stores and unless I visit say St. Louis (where it is headquartered) I have to mail-order.Anyway, I prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when I get an order ($56 for 2lbs) I leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off. That makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference. It frezes without problems so I will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up :). Licorice-gotta have it! Cans are lined w/ material that contains BPA which means the effort to grow the tomatoes organically was a waste of time.12-5-10  I didnt see the liner when I opened a different can from the same case.  Im scratching my head. I ordered 48 lollipops to use as party favors only to be disappointed that the front and back of the candy had writing on it. So I rewrapped them using clear bags purchased from Michaels. Also a few were cracked or broken, so luckily I ordered more than enough. Unwrapped they are so adorable! These are tiny packets. I bought them thinking they were the regular size and are not. My kids love the product, but this particular package was outrageously expensive for tiny packages. I sent them back. These are actually pretty good little potato puffs, and best of all - no CHEESE!  (unless you like that sort of thing, which we dont so its nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in it).Anyways- - these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like 10 minutes.  worth it for $10. These potatoes are good.  But i dont know if Id get them again.  The garlic taste to me was off and strong.  And I LOVE garlic.  Hoping I just got an \"off\" batch. Omaha Steaks 8 (5.75 oz.) Stuffed Baked Potatoes The Stuffed Baked Potatoes were unimpressive andlacking in flavor.I tasted no bacon or chives.However, they do make an attractive addition to ameal. Potatoes were good. Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality. Like I said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x-mas dinner today or I wouldnt have had enough. 24 oz. of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol. (not Omahas fault) a $5000.00 diamond would be cheaper to ship than a $5000.00 car!  I dont buy from any supplier that ships by price.This item is $7.95 then you pay $11.95 for up to $20.00 for shipping? No way I would pay that for one jar. I bought this because of the good feedback and bad luck that I have had with canned crab. I was hoping that this product was different than  previous canned crab that I have had. Alas, it is just a little better. Unfortunately, canned crab just seems to be not very good and I have  to stick with fresh expensive crab. Maybe these a better when theyre very fresh.  You could ruin dental work if not careful chewing these.  They taste great. I sent this product to my brother in law, so I have never seen the product and know nothing about it.  All I heard from him was that he was not impressed.  Other than that, I can say that it was delivered.  I ordered two of these going to different addresses and we got immediate feedback on the first one, but until we spoke to my brother in law, we had no idea if the product had even been shipped.  Would I order again?  Probably not...Thanks anyway,Curt U I have mixed feelings about NuNaturals Nustevia White Stevia with Maltodextrin Powder and will probably not purchase it again.  Dont get me wrong, its a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  In other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  In my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  If the labeling said 6.4% stevia extract, I would have passed on this from the beginning as I can get 70% dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. If this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as its easy to use and tastes great.  If youre accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this products mixture.Pros:- 5-star taste- Easy to measure- Perfect for first-time stevia users- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugarCons- Only 6.4% stevia- Not cost-competitive with 70% or pure dry stevia extracts- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugarOverall, a good product but not the best value.  I would given it 4 stars if the product labeling didnt try to hide the fact that its just not very potent.  For about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low-cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead (or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia).In case youre wondering where I got the 6.4% (by mass) value from, this is how I calculated it.  On a precise scale, I found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  The label says it contains 40mg per 1/4 tsp.  Thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  The concentration (mass) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.  Pretty weak stuff, but still much sweeter than cane sugar. Maybe my tastebuds are different but I bought this at a local healthfood store and Im not completely sold on it.  I tried it in my tea and it did leave me w/ an aftertaste...just like most sweetners. *shrugs* This stuff isnt bad at all. But you know how you can just eat spoon after spoon of really good caviar without toast points or crackers or anything? This roe is more for sprinkling over fish dishes, morning eggs or a caesar salad. All in all, for the price, its pretty good, I use red lumpfish caviar in a couple of dishes, and this brand is as good as any Ive found, though the red coloring is perhaps a little much! Thought these were the larger sized ones you see in stores but I was mistaken.  These pops are about 7\" inches long and a little less than 1\" inch wide.  Flavors are comparable to Flavor-Ice, not necessarily better.  My wife and I enjoy these throughout the year instead of ice cream, but we can only find them in our local grocery store during the summer months.  Glad we can get them via Amazon! These were on sale for $5.48 per box of 100 with free shipping, so I think we got a good value.  Without the sale pricing, Im not sure if wed choose these over another brand, but if they do go on sale again, we would probably buy them again.  Not bad, just a little small...  Eat two!  ;-) Are you familiar with the Hormel Compleats line?  If so, put this one in the middle of the pack.  Its not as good as the meatloaf or the meatballs/noodles in cream sauce.  Its better than the horribly taste-free chicken/dressing.  About even with the turkey.  Is that all Ive tried?  I forget; but you get the point.  Its medium-Compleat.Are you just thinking about trying a Hormel Compleat for the first time?  OK, then just remember these reviews on Amazon -- particularly food reviews -- are all simply opinions of customers, no scientific analysis intended (I hope).Compleats are quick, easy (except for pulling the plastic off the top) and generally edible.  Theres not a whole lot more to say about them.  I eat them because Im an old guy living alone and too often Im just lazy.  These do come in handy for a quick light meal.  \"Light\" depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy.This is a good one to lead off with if youre just now getting into Compleats.  Just note that, in my opinion, its middle of the road for the line.  Not a lot of flavor; but goes down OK. Ive tried several of the Compleats line, including this one, and they all have one thing in common: the picture on the box looks like a lot of food with a moderate amount of sauce on it, but the box actually contains a moderate amount of food with a lot of sauce on it.The Chicken and Rice flavor has some shredded chicken with rice, carrots and peas and a whole lot of chickeny flavored sauce. Its very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor. The texture of all of the ingredients is decent, neither too firm nor too mushy, except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too saucy. Overall, Id say its fine in a pinch - these shelf-stable meals are easier to find than most - but if you have other options available, these are only fair-to-middlin. Like the majority of other meals in the Hormel line, this one is excessively salty. That alone is tolerable though if only the meal wasnt swimming in sauce. This ends up being more like a soup than a rice meal which is an utter shame because everything else is fairly nice and the enormous amount of sauce ruins it.But its very quick and easy to make and fills you up so even a blah meal like this fits the bill. Its not my favorite of this type of meals but I wouldnt turn it down for lunch one hungry afternoon. Not bad, but like others say a bit too salty. I do notice a strange after taste, tho. I like Boyardees better. And wont buy this again. This is ramen, a cheap, easy, and fast noodle meal that is pretty cheap. Its got its pros and cons, but mostly its pretty alright. The chicken flavor is good. Some people find it too salty, I like it as is. The price here on Amazon is comparable to some groceries when its not on sale, higher than others. Still, if youre like me and want to avoid the stores as much as possible, maybe paying a $1 more for 24 isnt such a big deal. Nutritionally its pretty meh. You could do a lot better. But its also a versatile base- you can always add lots of veggies, meat, other spices, pretty much anything to this to dress it up and make it a better meal option. We keep it in the house for quick lunches when no one wants to cook a meal just for themselves. I like the concept, and I like Asian food, but the \"roasted peanut noodle\" variety of this McDougalls entree doesnt have enough peanut flavor for me.  Sauce is rather thin, too, and the flavors fine--just not sure I could identify it as peanut.  Ill try a different variety next time, I think. Tastes great. Price is okay. Received in timely manner, but two of the soup packages were bent. Hope the price comes down. For a 220 calorie dish that can sit in your desk drawer indefinitely, this really isnt bad. Its certainly better than Chef Bouyardee or Easy Mac or actual Cup of Noodles. Ive only ever had one other Dr. McDougalls product which was the Tortilla Soup and I much preferred it. I found this one to be a bit bland. It was pretty much just dried Cup of Noodles type noodles with some peanutty powder and a few green onions. I think the peanut flavor could have been more pronounced and I wasnt crazy about the texture of the noodles. I guess I was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut sauce.I only gave this three stars because I thought it was a bit of a let down. I liked it but I didnt love it as much as I should have given my love of peanut sauce. I would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but I certainly dont see myself buying them in bulk from amazon. My go-to Desk Drawer food is still Annie Chuns Udon Noodle Soup Bowl. The calorie count is pretty similar (I think Annie Chuns is like 280 or so) but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed pre-cooked noodles. However, if youre not in the mood for soup, these peanut noodles may be a better way to go after all. first time Ive tried this item, its just ok, the broth is tasty but the noodles are pretty bland to me My sister and I did a blind taste test with these to see if the price was worth it, and we couldnt tell the difference between these and the two other brands I had on hand. I wouldnt buy them again. I am a big fan of most of the freeze dried fruit and veggies, they are crunchy and flavorful and have NOTHING added.  The tomato fragments are extremely dry and tough, more like old sun dried, and for me they are only good when used in cooked dishes.  I do appreciate that these are organic! It is a good tasting product.It does not raise my blood sugar as much as regular pasta but you still cant eat a whole box and expect your glucose levels will be normal. Not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal. If youre looking for authentic Thai, this will give you only half the flavor, so the name that it is only a taste of Thai is quite accurate. Cartons are fancy, but big for the amount they hold. It is definitely enough for a meal, but if youre looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat, you had better grab two. It is tasty enough for a meal, but if you can get yourself to an authentic Asian supermarket, I guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and Im not talking about Cup O Noodles or things you find at American supermarkets. But overall, my husband and I, being the noodle-mongers that we are, did enjoy these as something new for the palate. However, we will probably opt to order Thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving. Its like eating a large box of paste.  I enjoy the flavor but I usually cook them and then mix with something else Im eating as its a no-go straight out of the box! Overall, this was good, but not great.  The ginger sauce seemed like it need an extra something to get it a fourth star.  I think I was expecting a little more ginger taste.  Id buy it again, especially if I can find a good way to punch it up just a little more.  I may try that egg tip! I bought these at walmart for less then $2.00 dollars a box.There over  $2.80 a box @Amazon for (box of six).Then you need to add another $7.00 dollars to your order to get free shipping ....I would not buy these again could be better if you added chicken or an egg like other reviewers mentioned. My box does say gluten free so maybe there are 2 versions. A year or so ago, I use to buy these quite often because they were gluten-free.  Last month I decided to order some again and this product no longer says \"gluten-free\" on the packaging and contains wheat.  I didnt want them to go to waste, so I ate one anyway.  I became very sick.  I do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat.  Just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheat/gluten. I dont plan on reordering it, but it was definitely edible and filling since I added chicken. These popchips were something I wanted to try because they were baked. The barbeque ones were okay but the rest of them were terrible. I agree with many of these reviews.  The product tastes good - not fantastic but good.  I dont like real, greasy potato chips and prefer Baked Lays.  However if you do enjoy real, greasy potato chips, please see the review referencing Pringles and Steven Baldwin.  very funny.Do buy these if you like an ocassional salty snack but dont want to devour a large bag of fat-filled chips.  Dont buy these if you are looking for a healthy alternative to chips - eat a banana or apple instead (and not those apple chips or banana chips because they are high in sugar).If you do get the big box - just put it some place inconvenient like the basement where you will have to exert some energy in order to get them - and if you do, BONUS! you just exerted energy and maybe earned a chip or two. Yum! I had tried the original and the Bar-b-q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack. For whatever reason the 24 pack is cheaper then the 12. The flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to MSG and gave my grandmother a bad headache. So if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to MSG, do not give them these.  These are tasty and a nice substitute for a greasy potato chip but they are not filling. You are better off eating a granola bar. Definitely better than Pirate Booty and slightly better than Baked chips. Very tasty but you feel as if youre almost eat something with the same texture as cereal. Its a small payoff to enjoy chips (albeit faux chips). The Vinegar and S/P ones are NASTY! I order these chips on a regular basis.  If you are doing Weight Watchers, these chips are 2 points a bag.  When this particular shipment arrived at my house, it was poorly packaged.  I received a case of crumbs instead of a case of chips.  This is the 1st time in the four times that Ive ordered these, hopefully it wont happen again. I am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them? Mainly, fat, fiber, sugars, and then any vitamins? Thanks so much!! I decided to try these based on the reviews - they are pretty good - especially for a more healthy option, but not sure Ill get them again. Not anything to rave about. They were okay. I think if I truly had a craving for chips I would just buy and eat \"regular\" ones. Wont buy again. Although they are mildly healthier, they dont taste as good as Baked Lays.Also, having a huge box of chips around isnt necessarily healthy because I ended up eating them more often.They are worth a try, but they just seem a bit overpriced (even with subscription savings) and over-hyped. Theyre okay, but not the most amazing thing ever.~ The Good ~Good flavor, no too strong or weak.Crunchy, but not too dry.Plenty of chips in each bag. Not just filled with air.Not greasy, so makes a good on-the-go snack.All natural, using no artificial flavors or colors.~ The Bad ~Sill plenty of fat per bag (3.5 grams per bag of the sour cream flavor) so dont get them expecting them to be low fat.Tastes like a low-fat chip, but with all the fat of regular chips.~ Conclusion ~Im 50/50 on if Ill order them again. I have a finicky stomach, and so Im fine with things that taste low-fat and healthy, since those are mostly what I eat. But these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked, so Im undecided on if I want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat. The all natural ingredients are what make this chip different, and what might bring me back for more. Its definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself, and see if you like them or not. I expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips. In reality I get an OKAY taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors. Chedder and Salt&Pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips Ive ever had. If youre just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a #2 on the list there are much much better brands out there. In the end I compare these chips to diet soda vs regular; Some wont tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it. Popchips are good and great for diet snack. But on Amazon the price is nearly double the cost of Costco. An 18 pack is only $7.89 at Costco. So for a \"healthier\" snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories. Each bag is 100 calories with 10% sodium intake for the day.The chips are not bad, i just wouldnt get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt. I really wanted to like these. All the reviews made it seem supernal, and, well as advertised, its not fried nor baked.However, even though it is advertised as being \"healthy\" but still with plenty of flavor, that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt. I only looked at the nutrition facts after I felt they were too salty, and I discover that a 100cal bag contains 10% dv of sodium.Im not a health nut, nor am I trying to diet. These were my first food purchase from amazon, and I bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller. However, I just couldnt get into these chips.I realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals tastebuds, and so I will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor. I personally enjoy chips where I can taste some potato as well. I have not ordered yet, my question is, from the description, it is 24 bags at 0.8 ounces. How does this equal 192 ounces in total weight? I first tried the BBQ flavor at a restaurant, which was good. Then, I was carried away with the 1/2 fat part, which made me pay without realizing my mistake!The \"Salt & Pepper\" is OK! ONLY OK, after trying another one, I changed my mind!The \"BBQ\" is good, but not that good!The rest is pure trash! I did not like them, what-so-ever nor my other 4 friends!The price is wayyyyyy high, and not worth it for a small single serving, as others such as Utz is WAYYYY better and cheaper!3 starts is too much for this over-marketed, less of flavor, and over-priced snack!AVOID!2 stars off: bad flavors1 star off: PRICY AS SH**!, and not worth it! The flavors are kind of funky salt and pepper? Tastes like someone just pored a jar of black pepper over the chips and the salt and vinegar, thee two varieties just make one go yummm EWWWWWW tossed out those verities but the others were very good. Less chip and more like a cracker with a chip flavor. Still a good item but I wouldnt suggest the variety pack unless you living dangerous and have lots of water to gag them down with. Im not as crazed about these as everyone else, but for a low-calorie snack, theyre fine.  They certainly dont do much to curb the appetite though. Im typically just as hungry after finishing as before - not like with Protein Chips (also available through Amazon). The texture is like rice crackers, which I personally dont like. Taste isnt too bad, but every single bags are too salty, even the original flavor. Id give four stars if they make low sodium chips. The salt.. is one of your worst enemies. I bet it does more harms to your body than MSGs. This seemed like the perfect way to limit my addiction to potato chips. Small, single serving bags.  I really like the plain, unflavored Popchips, but the rest of the flavors had an aftertaste.  I plan to set up Subscribe & Save for just the plain. Bought these based on the glowing reviews (4 1/2 Stars), and the fact that they were heavily discounted from the regular price. First of all .8 oz. per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag, which is not many. While this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories, fat or sodium, the fact is that .8 of an ounce is not much, and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time.  Due to the discounted price each bag was around $.55 each, not to bad until you figure that equals $10 per pound. At the regular price its about $16 per pound. As far as the taste, all of the flavors were good, none that I absolutely disliked, but none that really rocked my socks either. Bottom line, at the discounted price I paid I was not disappointed, but if I had paid the regular price for these I would have felt cheated. I actually purchased these. I myself find that they taste just like those like rice crisp with salt and flavoring. From the reviews I thought they was more like munchos. They are not. BBq to salty but if you like a little twang its ok. according to the family. Plain is horrible. Salt and vinegar was the best overall. My family gave it 3 stars i will stick to kettle chips- I like to take my lunch to work and this is perfect to give me just enough chips that I can munch on with my lunch. I love the flavors and the packaging is perfect. Worth the buy!  The price is right, the flavors are just what they want, portion size is good thus its a win, win situation for me and them. I really like the pop chips, but I do not like all the flavors. The only ones I like are the originals.  The rest of these flavors were really not good.  At least not in my family.  I gave them away to a senior center and most of the seniors didnt like them.  Sorry but it is a matter of taste and most things should stick to the originals, they are the best.This snack (originals) fits into my daily ww program for allot less money then snacks made for the programs specifically.I will continue to buy the originals and leave the others to others. Good texture: they are crunchy and not sharp (will not cut mouth)Flavor: They do not taste like potato chips. If I had not just opened the bag I would suspect they were stale. But no this is how they taste. Many others have remarked about the odd flavor as well.Healthy: good for dieting I suppose, low oil, and low saltI will not be buying these again. Next time I will order only the original flavor.  The other flavors did not suit me.  Too much of an aftertaste. These taste alright, but they are health food by no means. At least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices. This products is made of processed potato by-product and is natural by no means. The calorie savings isnt even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. Also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil (if eaten in moderation) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. In my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. If you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip. If you feel these taste better than the above, then by all means enjoy, but dont be tricked into believing these are healthy at all.Overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are. I purchased these because I was hoping for a healthy alternative to chips. Well, theyre fairly healthy: absolutely no oily residue on the hands and very light and airy. However, I just couldnt get over the taste, which I can only liken to slightly burnt popcorn. If that undercurrent of \"burnt\" flavor wasnt there, these might have been more palatable, but my taste buds kept zeroing in on that one aspect. Also, the seasonings werent consistently strong. Cheddar was o.k. Bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chips...the flavor was straight from a bag of Lays. However, I was very disappointed with the Sour Cream and Onion which was just too light in flavor and the Vinegar and Salt which didnt have as strong a tang as I would have liked.Overall, I would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and didnt mind a watered down version of a fried chip. However, I just couldnt stomach them. I gave away the unopened bags to coworkers (none of which were impressed either but theyre not on diets...lucky dogs). For now, Ill stick with my baked goldfish and bunny crackers. I bought this as a gift for my mother. She likes it but says it is hard to open. When she unwrapped it I remember having to help her figure out how to open it. It took me a minute. If you have arthritis you wont be able to pry this open! Ive had a couple of these for a few years but find that I dont use them all that often because their size & design limits their usefulness. For bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch, and its difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. It works great for asparagus, but only for small-ish bunches and if the spears arent too tall.More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1/2\" of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. These pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag-topped-jar, however, and the clear front makes it harder to forget whats in there.They are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over. And the little drain port is fun to use.But it only works for small bunches. I got one of these for XMAS...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.The main problem is the container is difficult to open. It does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.The thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it (you dont need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out FIRMLY). Dont worry...you wont break it. It is pretty sturdy plastic.The real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.Ive just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.PREPARA...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!! I tried Tropical Pineapple it was delicious. I gave a bad review for Tropical Fruit Salad becuase it had watermelon and pineapple in it I think the two of these were competeing for the flavor. I see now thats what I think it was, probably not a bad product at all. Sue This fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft slimey textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just slimey and icky. There are certain fruit that shouldnt be canned, and otherwise the crunchy pieces are fine. Much of the soft fruit I had to discard. Albeit, this item is good frozen and added to other fruit to make smoothies then you dont have to taste the slime. What are the white flecks floating in my recently ordered bottles of Dirty Martini Olive Juice? I have never had sea salt before but the 95% sodium free got to me.  It has to be an acquired taste because I dont really like it --- perhaps if I used it regularly I would not want to go back --- and, perhaps if the salt came from other seas around the world it might taste different as well... The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem. I have been using these treats for quite a while and both my dogs love them but both dogs are also way off their food and have been for quite some time and both have been acting kind of \"off\"...nothing major but just not exactly right. Well, I just happened to quit using these treats for a week or so and noticed both dogs came back to life and theyre eating like crazy. I cannot for certain pin it on these treats but its something to keep in mind if you are using them and your pet seems a little off kilter. If you like Werthers hard candies, you may like these. The pretty good caramels. But they are hard, and really sticky. Like \"do I have all my fillings?\" sticky.Eating a bag now. But I wanted caramels, and these really arent. The are closely related, but so different, in terms of texture.Not my cup of tea. If you like your caramels really hard (not hard candy hard, but still), you may love these. If you think caramels should be soft and chewy, you may not.Now, I just tried warming them up, and that really helped. Almost tempted to raise it up to 4 stars. Dont microwave it though. That turns them into a bubbling mass of goo! Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix is definitely a mouthful in name but, in taste, not so much.  Dont get me wrong, its not bad but, you could find any number of \"mixes\" that taste just as well and some even better.  I know my taste buds arent the same as yours so, whats just decent to me may be great to you.  I also wish I had bought just one can instead of 2 huge 33 ounce cans.  I finished the first can, Ill give the other can away and, Ill continue trying other mixes until I find the \"best mix\" out there.So far I seem to only be satisfied with a homemade mix for my waffles.  My preference is for waffles over pancakes but, this didnt make it on either count.  I even tried adding things to it but it didnt really help.  Maybe its just me.  Try it if you like but remember, buy only one can just in case youre like me.  You can always buy more. I love this pancake mix. Can not find this exact one in any stores so I always order online and keep in stock at home. All you do is mix with water (I add fresh chopped bananas or strawberries for a healthy option, and swap syrup for honey) and cook in a lil butter and you have an awesome breakfast. The best thing about this pancake and waffle mix is the can in which it comes.  I really like the convenience of the can and the fact that it reseals easily.The batter cooked up nicely and the texture was OK.  However I was very disappointed in the flavor.  There were stong overtones of chemical flavors.I will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future. Been curious about Stonewall since reading all the Amazon reviews but not sure about spending $$$ for a pancake mix.  The other day, found a big can at Sur La Tab store in San Francisco for only $10.95, so I thought, why not, this is my chance to try.  I was so looking fwd to Saturday morning and made it first thing today....all I can say is, underwhelming, nothing special.  I tried it following the instructions but using low fat milk and \"healthier\" butter, it was alright, but not great esp. considering the price.  Then I doctored it up a bit, added madagascar vanilla, flaxseed and psyllium which I usually do with my pancakes, tasted a bit better. Overall rating, 3 stars, just ok, stuck with the can so well eat it, but will not purchase again.  I will probably try it next time with full fat milk and butter as it recommended to see if that makes a difference, it probably does. I highly recommend Garveys Organic Pancake Mix, also here in Amazon, tastes so much better and fluffier.  If you like 100% whole grain pancakes, we also love Kodiak Buttermilk mix, also here on Amazon...healthy, hearty and so good, even my kids love it...and best of all its just add water, makes it portable, we even took it with us on vacay to Hawaii. When I read the reviews from other customers, I was excited about ordering and trying this mix. This morning we made waffles with both Stonewall Kitchen mix and Bisquick. The waffles from Stonewall were ok- and so were the waffles from Bisquick. The waffles were served to several people for tasting and everyone felt the same.The agreement was that Stonewall Kitchen product was not worth the significant extra cost. Furthermore, it is not available in our local super market whereas Bisquick is stocked. This will be a one time purchase for us. I am constantly on the search for delicious buttermilk pancakes because they are my favorite food in the world.  I like to make my own or get them at the Original Pancake House (which has the best buttermilk pancakes I have ever tasted).  I decided to try this box mix variation even though I am not a fan of box mixes.  The Stonewall brand has a very aromatic scent but thats where I ceased to be impressed.  These pancakes hardly rise at all and have a decent flavor and texture but are nothing to gush over.  Then again I guess Im one of the few who would gush over a plain bettermilk pancake anyway!!  Theyre ok but not worth all that money. Every week I make waffles or pancakes for my wife and daughter. Their opinion is that the waffles taste different from but not better than those I make with Jiffy mix. As Jiffy mix costs a lot less, I will not likely order this product again. This mix makes nice pancakes. They smell rich and vanilla-y, but you dont actually  taste it as strong as it smells. I wont buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close. Im just as happy using a Krusteaz brand mix that only requires the addition of water (no eggs or milk or flour necessary). Heck, if you want that vanilla smell and taste, add an eighth or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batter.Edited for grammars sake. I bought the mix at the same time as the Oster 3874 waffle maker and have been pleased with the results: light, well baked waffles that tasted good.  My problems with the mix were first the expense, secondly that the mix is very finely ground and flies around when poured and there may some sort of perfume added to it.  It simply smells too good.I am happy with the product but will probably not reorder it. We definately got a nice assortment of K-Cups but were really looking forward to trying the Peach tea which was not included in our shipment. I overlooked the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of Eggnog, French Toast, and a third winter type flavor. Slightly misleading from what is pictured. Dont get me wrong, I wanted to try the holiday sampler (mostly coffee) but I ordered the summer sampler with teas.  There were just a couple peach teas, sweet teas, and unsweetened black teas.  I didnt send it back because I wanted to try the holiday sampler.  Almost everything I got was the eggnog coffee, apple ciders, ginger bread coffee, and french toast coffee.  The box was labeled summer sampler, so Im sure that this was an accident.  I didnt contact the seller because I ordered it while I was gearing up for finals and now there is no contact seller button.  So seller, if you see this review message me and we can talk. The teas seem to brew really strong so use a large glass or dilute after... Unless you really like strong tea.Its a good pack to figure out which flavors you want to buy in bulk. i got a bag of these and the veggie sticks. havent tried the veggie ones yet. the sweet potato didnt taste like sweet potato to me. just tasted like rice flour and cinnamon and brown sugar. tastes like that cereal cinnamon toast crunch. i put the the so called skinny sticks in a bowl and added milk. taste better! I first tried these in a bundle of other gluten-free products, and it was so fresh. So I decided to buy it in bulk, and the expiration date was only three months. I ended up given most of it away because I didnt have time to eat all of the 12 packages I received. The taste is ok, not too sweet, but I found myself getting sick of it fast. The title of my review says it all (as long as it didnt get cut off). These have a lot more air in them than the Gerber Little Crunchies. These crush extremely easily and get dust/crumbs all over the place. Also, they do not taste nearly as good as the Gerber Little Crunchies. They might be better for you, and I like that it has a hint of veggies in it, but my 17 month old isnt very happy with them. Shell snack on them if thats her only option and shes really hungry, but she definitely will not choose them. We first got these several months ago and shes had the same reaction to them every time since then. I really wanted my kids to love it: these are very convenient on the go and should be delicious... or so it seemed. Unfortunately, none of the kids cared for it -- it tastes like stage 1 baby food (very bland) and is very runny too, so it can get quite messy if you squeeze a little too hard or if the child drops it. I know these are super trendy right now, and I totally wanted to love this product (or, to be more exact, I wanted my toddler to love this product). He took one taste, handed it back to me, and said, \"Why you gave me baby food, mom?\" I tasted it, and he is right. It tastes just like jarred baby food. Same consistency (not any thicker), too. If your kid likes the packaging, great. If your kid doesnt, then it is just really, really expensive baby food. Im going to give the rest to my baby, as the toddler is not the least bit interested. Ive been feeding this wet food to my dogs for 3 years, and as my husband has said \"if you through it in a crock pot and served it to me for dinner i would have no idea it was dog food.\" But i am a little upset with the fact that the cans arent full. In this last case some were even only half full. I have 4 dogs and this stuff isnt cheap. My little Lhasa Apso mix was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of months ago, so I found Merricks Grammys Pot Pie to be low glycemic, and decided to try it. He loves this food! It has chunks of potatoes, carrots, and peas, not to mention chicken and apples. The only downside about ordering it from Amazon is the delivery method. The day the food was delivered, a van pulled up in front of my house and left the 5 cases of food I had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the mailbox. Needless to say, someone could have taken it if I hadnt seen the delivery woman drop it off. Im also disabled, and if it hadnt been for my next-door neighbor being outside at the time, I couldnt have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help. Many of the cans were also extremely dented. Delivering items this way is not acceptable. I would have given this review 5 stars if it hadnt been for the delivery. so far, nothing extremely impressive. the taste to be honest isnt anything special (ive had MUCH better) and for the price you get what you pay for. a bit annoyed that the string is super cheap and always falls off but it came nicely packaged and arrived MUCH faster than i expected (by like 5 days) so i suppose thats a plus. all in all, if youre looking for something extravagant, keep looking. as for the benefits, havent really noticed anything new... but ill keep drinking for a couple weeks and see how that goes, then update my review... till then, yeah maybe i should i invested in something else (but since it was barely any money i guess i didnt do too bad).. This is NOT real peanut satay but for the price it is not bad. I like to get these and keep them in my desk at work for the days that I dont have time to go out to lunch. These are really easy to make; just mix together the cooked noodles and the bag of sauce and microwave for about 2 minutes. You will not get a restaurant quality meal out of this but it is decent for just over $2.00 a box. The box says it is 2 servings but if you are not mixing in any meat or anything, it really is only 1 serving. The Amazon product info claims they are a certified organic product.  The picture claims DOP certified.  Neither appears to be true.  The cans I received were just \"certified\", and it didnt say by who.  There is no USDA Organic label either.  I also knew all these things before I bought them since they are well documented in the Amazon reviews already, so I wasnt surprised by what I received.On the plus side, they are better tomatoes than I can buy canned in the grocery stores locally, so Im happy enough with them, and I used reward points from my Amazon.com Visa to buy them, so they were essentially free to me.Would I buy them again?  Maybe.  If couldnt get any of the Strianese D.O.P. certified San Marzano tomatoes, then yes I probably would.  As I said, they are tasty and I do like them better than what I can buy locally, but they arent the top tomato when it comes to what I can mail order. Received Different than pictured. Labels Just say \"certified\" not \"D.O.P. CERTIFIED\". Dont know if that is the same and after a couple of orders I am not going to put the effort in to find out.Also came with Basil. I want tomatoes only. Not Basil.A couple cans dented like others have said.My case was $44 now its $60.Im over the tomato thing. Ill buy what I want in the store. If your child is truly lactose intolerant, this product is great.  If fussiness/gas is an issue, then consider staying with Similac Advance or another formula that is made primarily with **milk**.  This product did seem to create less fussiness in our baby, but honestly I think the Dr Brown bottles made a bigger impact.  Make your own trade-off between fussiness vs. nutrition, just be aware of which formulas are made with corn sweeteners and which are truly milk-based.Its misleading for the company to label the product as \"milk-based\" when it has minor ingredients \"derived from\" milk.  Read the list of ingredients (below).  I found the ingredients on the parent companys website (Abbott Nutrition).

We just changed to Gerber Good Start Gentle due to sugar in this product.  This did seem to work better than a couple other formula but I decided to try something else when I read about sugar.  We just changed over to Gerber Good Start Gentle and it does (so far) seem to be working better.  He is still gassy but he has less pain and doesnt seem in nearly as much discomfort when eating (he is a little colic but still loves to eat).  I do this this is a good product and Im sure the sugar is safe, I just would rather not give extra sugar at this age (8 weeks).  Good luck!! Traditional English Muffins are usually fat free or having very little fat.  This little challenger should be called something else all together.Closer to what I would say a croissant is, having all of the buttery taste and fat to go with it.Terrific if thats what you are looking for in an English muffin but not what Im looking for.  I would rather save the fat for a chocolate dessert. I really like the frozen Corn Muffin Tops, but the mix resulted in a dryer product. I used the paper muffin liners and I think these might have added to the dryness. The tea bags work well with loose tea and buying the pack of six makes this a good value. But what youre not told is that the bags are the large size, better made for large pots and not single cups. I love these cookies, but this paticular batch was stale, very hard, & I had to dip them in my coffe to eat them easily. They taste nice, but they made my stomach hurt and gave me a bit of flatulence issues (because of the chicory root fiber). It also made me bloated. Too mild for me... I like a strong flavor. My wife likes this coffee. Has enough flavor and boldness to keep it enjoyable and not feeling like water downed coffee. If you like strong, bold coffee, you will be disappointed. For a mild coffee, I found this good, but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other brands.I will not be re-ordering Caribou Mahogany. My wife prefers Donut Shop brand over this. Again, not strong enough for me, but still makes a good cup of coffee. This coffee is inoffensive, but not strong enough for my tastes.  I do use cream, and Im sure that makes a difference. This coffee is not really bold in my opinion - it falls more along medium roast flavor. Its a decent, smooth coffee, but I didnt think really bold. Like all k-cups though seriously overpriced! This coffee is very full bodied, and has a great aroma; however, it is the only K-Cup coffee Ive had that has a bitter aftertaste. I would still drink it if someone offered me a cup, but I wont buy it again. We loved this product and I just received my new order.  I noticed the packing changed which made me check the label.  The ingredients and NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION HAS CHANGED!Old Ingredients & Nutrition (sample)Natural Coconut WaterNatural Pineapple JuiceCane JuiceVit C.Natural Fruit FlavorSodium 115mgPotassium 299mgSugar 16gVit C 172%Calcium 1.3%Iron 1.8%New Ingredients & Nutrition (sample)Coconut WaterPineapple JuiceSugarAscorbic AcidNatural FlavorSodium 45mgPotassium 425mgSugar 20gCalcium 2%Iron 0%Magnesium 2%Vit C 210%96% JuiceMaybe the new box is misprinted as it says 96% juice and the packaging clearly says \"a splash of pineapple and other natural flavors\".No thank you...Ill be cancelling my subscription.  I dont why the change. To me, this tastes more like pineapple juice than coconut.  There is an underlying hint of coconut, I know the water isnt strongly flavored, but I wasnt expecting so much pineapple.  This is tangy and sweet.  It is alright.  Package is smaller, but I dont think I could handle too much more of it in one sitting.  I am not thrilled with their unflavored coconut water, it is too tangy/sour to me, so with the pineapple it helps cover up that funkiness for me.  Not sure Id buy this again.  Still in search of the one I first tried and fell in love with, but so far not finding anything as light and fresh tasting. I didnt expect coconut water with a splash of pineapple juice to taste quite so salty, even if it does replace electrolytes, so that was off-putting.  Its not really bad, especially over ice, but I wont be ordering any more of it. This is good but not as good as the standard coconut water in this brand.  The container is smaller, there is no straw, and I like the taste of the plain one better.  It is OK. My top line advice: If you want coconut water with a touch of pineapple, get the Vita Coco, not this one.Size: The size is 8.5 fl oz per package. I didnt pay close attention when ordering, and expected the larger, 11.5 oz size. Not a big deal, and was my fault, but its a little too small to be useful.Taste: Ick. I love coconut water. I love pineapple juice. I love lightly flavored coconut water. This tastes like none of the above. The flavor is sickly sweet (ingredients included added sugar), and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters Ive tried. Might as well be a processed kids drink.Alternatives: While I actually prefer O.N.E.s regular, unflavored coconut water over other brands, the Vita Coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one. It comes in a larger package, doesnt have added sugar, has more vitamins and nutrients (this one is diluted with sugar water), and tastes like youre drinking it fresh on the beach. This one is just...not great. I wanted to try this juice as Im a big fan of coconut flavoured products.  Given that it claims to have a \"splash of pineapple\", I was expecting a light pina-colada flavour.On opening the package, I could smell the hint of pineapple, and Id say the taste of pineapple is a bit stronger than the coconut water.  Probably because Ive mostly tasted coconut milk and not water, Id say this was nothing like what I expected.  Its not bad for thirst quenching, but it wasnt my favourite drink in terms of taste. hi every one I just wanted to share some of my experience with you about this product. First off all it taste pretty good but its kinda sugary and salty. Its an ok drink but when you think about it and you compare it to others this drink is not as healthy as others. Its more like a juice drink than a healthy one. Compared to Vitacoco it has more calories, twice the sodium, half the potassium and almost half the vitamin C. This drink also has less magnesium, phosphorous, and 4 times less calcium. The only this the drink does have over Vitacoco is the 1 less gram of sugar. Overall pay the extra price and get a better drink for your body and if you dont believe me go to the websites and check the facts below or check it out on their web site.O.N.E.

It does have a unique flavor, but is kind of rich and tiring, so I recommend you mix it with other coffees to make it taste better and make you other bland coffees taste a little better. The active ingredient in this sytemic is imidacloprid.  It is adbsorbed by the rose plant into the leaves, but not the flowers I learned recently online.  I have been using this stuff for years and obseved this, but put it down to my not giving the plant enough granules.  Unless you SPRAY the flowers with another product containing the insecticide, the Japanese beetles devour the rose flowers and leave th leaves alone. see link[...] This soup is very good tasting if you like seafood, like I do. I am finally finishing my case of cans, because it is good food. However, I do not plan on getting any more of this particular product because every can has a little something extra: bits and pieces of chitinous shell, mostly from the shrimp but also a few hard pieces now and then from the lobster. They are small pieces, which means taking small spoonfuls and not biting down hard on anything, and dont eat the last spoonful. I find six to eight pieces of this debris in each can. Like I said before, I am finishing the case, because it is food and pretty good at that. But I just dont appreciate having to be that careful with my soup. For canned soup, it hits the spot decently.  Theres definitely some lobster flavor and small chunks in it.  However, the whole thing tastes a little on the fishy side.  If I was served this in a restaraunt I think Id walk out. As someone who lives and dies by seafood Ive had my fair share of lobster bisque. This stuff, while not completely horrible, needs some love before its decent. The texture isnt quite there, not thin enough to be soup but not up to bisque level either. As for the taste, its rather bad. A little on the bland side. As a Marylander I reached for the one thing that fixes all things seafood, Old Bay. Dumped in a liberal amount and stirred while still on the heat. The Old Bay added a nice taste that made it tolerable to eat. Doubt Ill be purchasing this brand again though. I advise you to do your own web search to determine how the health risk could affect you. The tomally functions as the lobsters liver and pancreas. However, even in the cold Scottish waters, dioxin and other harmful agents have been present and there are warnings for the general public. I was disappointed to discover this information, so I only ordered the mushroom and seafood flavors. I have bought ground flax in the store, there was always a rancid aftertaste.  This is the best tasting flax I have ever had.  BUT, I have to throw it in the coffee grinder, and then pick out little rocks that are barely bigger than the seeds.  I found this out the hard way after using the seeds whole.  Nothing like working a bite trying to find where the rock you just bit is.After you grind, sift the powder and black stones will be evident.  I have about 1-2 per quarter cup of ground mixture.  Perhaps this is something you organic foodies are used to, I am not.I have only used 1 bag so far, so I cannot comment on whether or not the stones are in the others, but I highly doubt it was a fluke bag. It was my mistake - I thought there were 6 bags rather than 4. So the price per bag is much higher than what I pay at the local grocery for the same product. not real crazy but this product. They did not taste good but looked real cute in the little booties I made for the baby shower tables. I thought it was okay but not Harbanero BBQ sauce from Hell.I would probally not get it again.Also it was not worth the money I thought it was kind of a ripoff it was 10$ for barbque sauce you could have made at home. This tea is not so tasty in my opinion. But one thing about opinions is that every one has one and we do not always agree. I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity \"kool-aid\" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesnt make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, its really a good deal as far as price. When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. Im already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said \"natural\", I expected it unsweetened).I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, youd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong \"mint\" flavor.But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (Im an experimenting foodie so doesnt hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :) This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected. Ive had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and Im pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, its like youre drinking a flavorless algae.Otherwise, its a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you cant beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea. I wanted to love this but I just didnt. Despite being sugar free it has 15 calories per pump and in my opinion needs three pumps to add enough flavor to my iced vanilla lattes. If your going for calorie count this isnt favorable. I would however say if you think other brands are a bit too sweet or if calorie count isnt overly important you should give it a go, it may be just what you were looking for! As a side note if calorie count is unimportant I recommend their coconut cream flavor<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZU3JJ4\">Amoretti Premium Coconut Cream Syrup (750mL)</a>, its delicious! The gourmet corn is smaller kernels than I like so would probably not buy it again.  But with their special oil and the Stir Crazy Popper every kernel pops every time.I will probably return to good old Jolly Time. I was disappointed.  I thought being Amish and according to the advertising that it would be exceptional.  But its just popcorn, no better than others Ive purchased.  So, so. I would not buy it again. Wish I would have read the reviews that discuss the products performance in hot air poppers.  The PC is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth...4 stars.Problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop.  Tilting the machine helps keep them inside, but it would be simpler just to find another larger kernel corn. This is my first time trying Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Baby White.Pros: Its okay with a nice mild nutty flavor. The hulls are more pronounced than with some other Amish \"Baby White.\"Cons: It tends not to briskly pop up. In fact, weve burned several pans because popping it is tricky. We found that the microwave often works better than pan popping. And as mentioned above, the hulls are much more noticeable than with other Amish \"Baby White\" brands.We purchased these 6 bags and well use them up but wont be ordering any more. Next time well drive the long distance to our nearest Amish store. If you like your popped corn small this is for you. Taste is good and it is crisp yet tender. The only real complaint is it has a disproportional amount of hull. Received the \"Baby Yellow\" instead of the correct \"Baby White\" kernels. Unable to return the product since its a grocery item, but Amazon.com customer service did an excellent job and provided a full refund. As far as can tell, no other issues with product. The Popcorn was delivered as promised in an attractive wrapper. I used the Whirley Pop popcorn maker and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and popped it according to the instructions of the whirley popper. While the majority of the kernels popped, there was also a large amount of seeds or residue that can get caught in your teeth and are somewhat distracting while youre eating. I actually got better results using Orville Redenbacher White Popcorn Kernels in the Whirley Popper (and it was actually cheaper at the local market). Overall I give Amish Country 3 out of 5 stars and mostly for the presentation of the package than for the yield results. This is good popcorn, but it is very small so you need to make twice as much as you normally would. Ive had better canned clam chowder.  Bookbinders is one that comes to mind.  I dont buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients, so my choice is limited.  For this one, if I add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter, along with some extra sea salt, its ok.  The longer it is gently heated -- not simmered or boiled -- to let the flavors mingle, the better it becomes.  More clams and potatoes would improve it.  As it is, the ingredients were skimpy. We had high expectations for this product but the chowder was only average.  Warming instructions are vague as to the amount of milk and/or butter to blend in with the soup mix. We found the flavor to be bland and one dimensional, even with as little as 1/2 cup of added whole milk.The package of six cans contained three dented cans.  Two of them were severely dinged on the seamlines and had to be tossed.  For this reason, we will no longer purchase can goods through the mail. I just finished my first bowl of this clam chowder, and was disappointed to find, or rather, not find, clams. Dont get me wrong -- the soup was good, with a very nice texture and taste, but the clams were AWOL. Several times I bit into something that provided a small burst of clam flavor, but only once did I find a clam fragment big enough to look at. Im going to buy some chopped clams to kind of \"chum\" a bit. This, of course increases the cost of the meal. Im going to try some other brands as well.I do hope that Bar Harbor does some testing. The label shows clams as the most prevalent ingredient, but I dont see how that can be -- my money is on the potatos. ...........but still not that great. Its bland. Even when I added salt, pepper, milk, and butter, it didnt taste like the best Ive had. But at least its edible, unlike every other canned clam chowder out there. If I can find a way to make this taste better than Id love it. Its the best CANNED clam chowder Ive ever had, but its not that great. The clams taste good.EDIT: I had a 2nd can and I made it today, I added only a little bit of milk and I added NO salt, pepper, or butter, and it actually tastes a lot better than when I did. So I suggest adding nothing but some milk or cream to this soup. Its still not the best Ive ever had though. I was really excited to try clam chowder from Maine but it did not wow me.  I think Campbells might even be better.... Our dog loves this stuff. I bought it for a occasional treat since he only eats dry dog food, I thought it would be a nice treat for him to have a lil something extra every now and then. But this stuff stinks really bad like dirt, it makes the whole area where the dog eats smell like we just opened and bag of soil in the house. If they could improve the smell of it, that would be awesome, because our dog just loves it but we cant bare the smell of it. With the Prime shipping, this made a great last minute gift. It seems a little pricey for the amount of fish, but the quality was good (according to the person I gave it to). In the end, I think this is better than a fruit basket or something similar. I think pack of 4 for $25.00 is too much ($6.25 per box). I got them in Target for less than $3.00 sometimes. Also, maybe because of promotion, I got them for $2.80 or around that at Safeway. I will not buy this one online. TASTE is FIVE STARS, but price is ONE STAR. I subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that its changing from 17 oz. to 16.9 oz. - but no price change?  WOW thats a really lame cut to increase their profit margins.  Whatever I wont miss the .1 oz. obviously but how about messaging and acknowledging your devoted consumers. Its very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly theyre lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesnt weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if youre hungry.  Still, its a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they dont feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, Id personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But thats why theres chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla! With any low fat or low calorie food, youre going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.Its a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of \"100 calorie\" snacks, but I think youre better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these. Sorry, but I wasnt terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, theyre not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, theyre not so good for you. If youre going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, its got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre. I ordered this because it is Science Diet and it says it is minced. Well, it is NOT minced and my cats do not like it. It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they cant eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money. This food is working well for my 19 1/2 year-old-cat with kidney problems.  But I cant find any info on how many cans are included for this price?  Im guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price, but I wont buy without better info. I ordered this thinking it would be a yellow cake mix.  It is a heavy cake and is brown. That said, it comes in handy to make streusel coffee cake, upside down cake and other augmented recipes because it is a basic mix and in those recipes the heaviness isnt a problem.  Plain cake though was disappointing.  So get creative instead. This tastes just like Wint-O-Green Life Savers. Its a hard, sweet, crunchy ring, with a minty flavor. That pretty much describes it. Its a crunchy mint shaped like a ring. This is good popcorn, I have purchased before in Hawaii.  I was happy to see that I can order online.  However, I purchase the 20 pack and they overstuffed the box.  There is no bubble wrap or any type of wrapping around the individual packages before they put it into the box.  They choose a small box that can barely fix all twenty packages.  It is overstuffed to the point that the box is no longer squared, but rounded somewhat.  The postal service does not treat the package with care, so when it arrived, there was a wet stain.  When we opened it, two packages had been damaged, and the butter leaked all over all the other packages.  We had to spend a long time washing all the packages, because they are all greasy.  The greasiness does not wash off easily even with soap.  Now when eating them, some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing, they are not air-tight packages.  So when popping them, there are a lot of unpopped kernels.  They should use bigger boxes and wrap it better. Although I think this pen is great...I didnt receive the entire roll of polytape..even after calling customer service...and I think the height of the posts is misleading..hence the 3 stars.  If I wanted to buy a new energizer and more polytape then it would be great to own, as my review below states:Easy one-page instructions and everything fits nicely back inside the bag, without struggling...I needed this portable paddock for my goats because I have a lot of unfenced acreage beyond the barn area.  I was worried about the fence being suitable for goats so I called Customer Service...The rep went to a lot of trouble and checked this for me and said it would work fine for goats as well.  However, several days later, I called back and spoke to another rep and he said that goats needed much higher voltage.  This particular energizer is 3,000 volts and that goats needed 5,000 to 8,000 volts. But he said I could just buy another pulse type energizer and it would work with the tape that I have.  I have older, very mellow goats so the 3,000 volts are working so far.I have different breeds and therefore different heights of goats and one concern was that the clips on the post wouldnt be low enough to the ground for my mixed breed goats but on the post, it has clips all the way down so that the tape can be hung at various heights.  However, even though the post is listed as 4ft high, I measured and they are actually 47 1/8  inches tall and after you push the metal tip into the ground, you are left with a height of 38 inches.  The tape rests at the bottom of the top clip which holds the tape at 35 inches off the ground.  Seems awfully short for horses but I dont know anything about horses either.The instructions are clear and has helpful diagrams, making it all very easy to put together.  I did have problems at the end tying it to the last post.  I had to call Customer Service, and the rep said that you CANNOT unroll the whole spool of polytape if you are hanging it to the last post via the spool, which is per the instructions.  Since I had already unrolled it to the end, I had to tie the end of the polytape to the post or to the empty spool container, which he said was okay, but then its not easy to untie that knot.In lieu of posts, you can hang the guy wire around trees and then slide the electric tape through the loop.  Guy wires, which are similar to tent stakes give the posts extra stability, but I saw no need for them at all since the clay soil held the posts very well.My ground is hard clay but the fence posts sunk in easily, despite that.  It had rained within the last week though so it may be different depending on the dryness of the soil.  The posts are sturdy, and strong enough to not break with normal use.  I did have gravel in some spots which made me have to relocate a few posts, since the tips would not go past them.There is no mention of the tape being allowed to touch weeds and grass, so I called Customer Service back to find that out. He said that that only a low impedance energizer can be used near grass and this energizer is NOT low impedance.  So, I had to mow where I wanted to put the fence to avoid any problems with grounding.  Not very practical when out on the road.Planning the fence was harder than I imagined because I couldnt make a perfect square and I thought I had measured correctly but still fell short of where I wanted the fence to end.  I then discovered that I was only given 126 feet of polytape rather than the 200 feet.  Doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommended.I wanted something that was easy.  Im a small middle-aged female and needed something that wasnt too much trouble so I could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears.  This is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape.  It seems too short for horses but I posted the measurements in case it helped someone who has horses. I really liked these cookies when they first came out.  But then I got a little tired of them.  They have a bit of a gritty texture, and they dont taste the way you hope they will when thinking of an Oreo.  They are worth eating if you have a bad craving, but I cant eat more than one or two.  The different taste gets to me.  There may be an ingredient in them that doesnt agree with me.  They contain vegetable oils, just like Oreos do.  Palm oil is in practically everything these days because it is cheap for companies to use.  When I eat it, it leaves a thick, greasy film in my mouth and throat.  Store-made cake frostings, cookies, cupcakes...anything that has it leaves that feeling, and I dont like it at all.  Some are worse than others, making it hard to swallow.  This happened when I ate a double-stuf chocolate WhoNu cookie.  Palm oil is listed as an ingredient.  I stopped buying them and the regular chocolate.  I only get the vanilla version.  They contain palm oil as well, but Im guessing it is less because they dont bother me.  I like them much better.  Its weird because I like chocolate sandwich cookies better than vanilla ones in general.  But with Whonu, the vanilla wins for me.Yesterday I had a craving for a chocolate sandwich cookie, and I bought Oreos.  Even Oreos dont taste as good as they used to.  I guess since the trans fat change in products.  The WhoNu cookies have the extra vitamins and nutrients, and less sodium.  But the Oreos have a better flavor.  The difference in fat content doesnt seem to be very different.  Actually, the difference in sodium doesnt seem very significant, either.  I decided Id rather eat a few Oreos than a few of these.  Its something you have to decide for yourself when comparing the pros and cons. I was really looking forward to the Dulce de Leche Cheerios.  The Honey Nut flavor has been my favorite since they came out and the thought of caramel was quite appealing.The first few spoonfuls seemed quite yummy.  But the more I ate, the less I enjoyed it.  The caramel flavor seemed a bit off to me or maybe it was that these are more corn than oat so the flavor was different from that as well.  (Oats are the third ingredient after corn and sugar; I thought Cheerios were always oat cereals.) All things considered (especially price), Ill stick with Honey Nut.They tasted pretty good just plain from the box so I think Ill save them for when I want a slightly sweet snack but not too sugary.  Ill pour out a handful and eat them like a toddler!I expected these to be more sugary than the Honey Nut but these have 6 grams of sugar per serving compared to 9 grams for the Honey Nut.  But they have the same total carbohydrates, 22 grams per serving, so there isnt much difference in how it affects your body.Bottom line:  I wont buy them again. These brownies bake up very nicely.  I would call their consistency \"cake like\".  However my husband called them Healthy Brownies.  He said he could taste the flax seed.  I tend to agree.  In my opinion, if Im going to eat chocolate, I dont want it to have that \"healthy\" taste.  On the other hand I love the Blueberry Muffins that Hodgson Mill makes. I like that this item has flax seed in it but the whole wheat flower makes it very grainy.  It is also very oily even after you cook it.  If you do not mind gritty brownies then get this product.  Also, they are not very chocolately so I added chocolate chips to the recepie.  It makes it have more fat and calories but they taste better this way. I was hoping for a health substitute for white flour brownies.  Its OK, but not what I would serve to company.  I substitute canola oil for the butter or margarine and that may have been the problem.  Of course, I wound up eating them all anyway. I like the dried peas from Just tomatoes and I also like their Just Corn.  They are way too expensive though.  They are really handy because I dont use frozen or canned foods because I follow an Ayurvedic diet which prohibits them.  When I can not find fresh peas I have to use these.  I will probably have to do without as I cant afford these, too bad. I struggle between giving this 3 or 4, even 5 stars - because I am just thankful for the substitute, as I have a condition that I need low acid coffee for. However, I DO have to admit, it tastes like burnt coffee (as someone else put it) and it is no Peets or Starbucks. The taste, and the flavor it leaves in your mouth after you are done, is something I dont think I will ever get used to.Update: I had my father in law up. Would like to say that if you are one, like he is, that puts mounds of creamer and sugar in your coffee...apparently you will not notice a difference in taste from this brand to another. Hope that helps! If you dont want to give up the taste of coffee but cant handle the acid try this coffee. Does not taste like gourmet coffee but it does not produce acid side effects. I love, love, love dark roasted coffee and dont like a acid taste so I thought this would be great,I was pleased with the no acid taste,\" but...I had to use twice as much to get the same flavor I usually like. That wouldnt be a big deal- but it meant I went through the coffee faster than I should have and that can get expensive.This blend was ground very finely so would not be good with a french press. I was able to use it with a pour over. I was a little disappointed...I first made the muffins with it and then let the bread machine make and bake a loaf - ok.  Next I will try mixing it myself and baking in my oven.  I do have to keep in mind though that potato bread is dense and heavier than say white bread.  Convenient is a plus. howdy yall,this bread is pretty good. the potato flavor is there, recognizable as potato bread [if youve had it before] and not overwhelming. makes a good sandwich bread with meats or an enjoyably different pseudo-bruschetta base.made it with vegetable oil and olive oil. as usual, the good olive oil makes for a somewhat better flavor.rated a THREE cuz its just exactly as expected - average with no surprises.take care,lee I am a bit disappointed.  The flavor was not what I wanted or expected. As a former chef-owner of a restaurant in my younger years, I was  surprised and delighted at the exceptionally good taste and texture of the Bookbinders White Clam sauce wihtout doctoring.  It is a great product for easy convenience. This water is pretty good, but not great. At the time I got it, it was the most economical water that shipped free with Prime, so if they keep that up, it will be a great deal for a lot of people.I might be tainted, because I was just up in Washington, where this water is from, and almost all of the bottled water I got up there, plus the tap water, was better than this. But, I love Washington water, so Im probably judging it too harshlyIts not bad, and it does have a unique water taste, so Im sure this will be someones absolute favorite water. No one will hate this water.Pros:+This is good water+Has a unique taste+Everyone will like it, but not a lot of people will ask for moreCons:-I expect more from Washington water than this I bought this water when i was at college for the first week. I felt bad using my roommates water all the time and i was 7 states away from home. So i ordered this water. It was delicious, but the only complaint i have is that the bottles were REALLY...well...plastic-y. I felt really un-green drinking water out of these HUGE plastic bottles.So now, i just ask my roommate to buy water for me when she goes home on the weekends. I give her $ 4, she runs to walmart and gets me 2 cases of 30 water bottles. Yay me!Sometimes i still think about this water, longing for it as i sip my coffee or tea or ramen-juice and say to myself \"This would be so much better with talking rain.\"Its one college students battle between deliciousness and eco-friendliness. the clams were ok overall, quality ext accept only calf the can is filled with clams and the other half is mostly juice. also i expected larger chunks rather than small pieces. product is good though. Even on the small cup setting of the elite, these are a little weak for me.  Make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak.  I also run a cup of hot water thru the maker before using these so there is no coffe taste to them. Makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop.  Not as sweet as I would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in suspension.  I guess I can add marshmallows:-) Its okay but it does not have a rich chocolatey taste. I actually find it to have a funky taste, cant quite figure it out. I was expecting something more... considering the Keurig does such a good job with coffee.But this stuff? Everybody who sampled it here said it tasted just like Nestles powdered hot chocolate in a mug with hot water. Watery, sugary, and nothing special. I saw these on sale so I nabbed them.  For anything larger than a 6oz cup, the results will be too weak.  I end up brewing one with 6oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of it.The peppermint was the flavor I was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that I loved the most.  Im on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k-cups in the future.  It might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my Keurig. My kids like this cocoa, but I find flavor less delicious than the more expensive <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VQXYMQ\">Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>. My oh my is this cocoa sweet. Too sweet Id say. Youre better off making hot cocoa from scratch. I bought this because I thought the minty flavor would be good, but its too sweet. So are the dark and milk chocolate flavors. The product is not bad, but must brew at smallest cup size or it has no flavor.  Definitely an aftertaste. Watery. This product is nice and the price is right but it isnt Swiss Chocolate for sure.Just doesnt have that real deep chocolate taste. I bought this brand of hot chocolate K cups cause it had the best review on Amazon at the time.  The kids love it - they especially like the peppermint flavor which I cant see any other way to get except in this mixed box.  You get milk chocolate, dark chocolate and peppermint flavors.  I tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste.  I make it on the lowest setting on my Keurig which I think is around 7 ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them.  If you like a strong chocolate flavor this isnt it. I HATE SUCRALOSE.Honestly, I dont know how other people CANT taste it when its in sweetened products. Its got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just cant ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.Still, I cant believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but dont say theyre a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. Its frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also dont like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I wont go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).Theres one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and thats Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.My opinion? Its probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. Its not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.So, if youre into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If youre like me, though, and cant stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesnt have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. Its also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and its no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon. Does not have a rich chocolate flavor. Tastes a little watery. Not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it. Good flavors in this combo. Not really strong but I will just set the machine on less water next time. I like it ok, but it isnt anything great. I have a hot water tap and it is just as easy for me to make the powder packs at home at a fraction of the cost. Ill go back to that method and save my $$ for coffee. Unfortunately, I am conflicted with my purchase.Although the final product was quite good, 4 stars. The quality of the delivery is why they lost an additional star. I opened the Amazon box to find that there was hot chocolate powder coming out of the Grove Square packaging. I opened it to find that 2 of the K-Cups werent sealed properly on top and were spilling into the box. I inspected both the Amazon package and the Grove Square both of which had no visible exterior damage.I was disappointed with both Grove Square for the quality of their product and as a result I am not sure I would buy this product again. The flavor of this cocoa is good, but I found that it was a little too watered down with the normal amount to water. The second cup was better when I used less water. This is okay cocoa. Its not really very smooth, and its a little watery. I had high hopes, as I love dark chocolate hot cocoa, and the reviews were good. I will finish the box I bought, but will try another brand next time. just got a new keurig and was looking for a great chocklate drink/still looking/this is fair at best/watery and nothing to brag about This is the best Hot Cocoa I have found so far, BUT I hope I can find better. Its not real chocolately. Wish it were a bit sweeter but on the whole, I would buy it again if I cant find better. Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k-cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  Im shocked that the item descriptions dont make this clear.  I consider that important information!I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.Sadly, this one does too.  Its close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but its still unmistakable, especially if you dont consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and thats it for me.)Its a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I wont be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that theyre instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it werent for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos dont have.)If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, Id buy it, but until then Im staying away from Grove Square products. Just tried this for the first time today.  They are \"ok\", but they do have an odd aftertaste.  Not sure Ill be ordering these again.  Also -- the packaging notes that you need to run a hot water cycle (without a k-cup) after making them (I assume to clean the machine out). I think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery. My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa. Not sure I will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups. Sometimes I think you are better off buying Swiss Miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine. I didnt expect much from powdered cocoa in a cup, but heres a tip: put on 8oz setting, then add a 1:1 ratio of heated milk. It tastes amazingly good!Of course if you add a little Baileys Irish Cream, it tastes even better. This has artificial sweetener just like the other hot chocolates out there. If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isnt very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didnt have the artificial sweetener aftertaste. Everyone has their own preferences, I know -- I actually liked the flavor, but my wife tried it and couldnt stand how sweet it was.  To each his/her own, I guess.  But, now that IVE had a second cup, I tend to agree -- very sweet. I bought this becaue they were $9.99 for the 24 pack.  I could try them for .50/cup.  Other in the store were almost $1/cup.  Overall they are ok/good but you need to run a hot water flush throuhg you maschine afetr each use or there is a potential to have the residue gunk up you drain area. It wasnt a bad purchase at just $9.99 through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon and shipped for free, but took 2 stars off because it wasnt a freshness issue but Cracker Jacks® just dont taste the same like when I was a kid back in the 1980s. Product was older then I would purchase if I knew what the date on the individual boxes was before purchase. It gives me only one month to eat them all before being outdated. I purchased cases of these for our company picnic. The boxes were cute, the idea of it all was a big hit. But the \"gift inside\" was a bust. I would gladly have paid more for a stupid little item rather than the \"writings on paper,\" or whatever they were. What is Cracker Jack without the gift inside? I find it to be misleading that they call it \"Original.\"  Original had the gift inside. I really liked this flavor!  As someone with many food sensitivities who also avoids sugar, this is the perfect treat for me when I crave chocolate or baked goods.  The raw nuts are crisp and fresh tasting.  However, the price was very high for the quantity of product.  With less than 20 brazil nuts in the package, I felt a little gipped.  In future, Ill try making my own chocolate nut mix from bulk raw nuts, berries, and coco powder rather than spend $9 per package!  For that price, Id like a lot more product. These arrived fresh and in a timely manner.  However, flavor-wise our family is in agreement that Jelly Belly produces a richer plum flavor, slightly larger sugar plum in size, and a bit softer in texture for their sugar plums.  The price on the Albanese sugar plums is reasonable, the flavor is good and its always nice to support a small, independent candymaker! PERHAPS AMAZON SHOULD START A SCRATCH AND DENT SECTION AND SELL ITEMS LIKE THIS CORN THERE! ALL BUT ONE CAN OF THIS GREAT TASTING CORN WAS DENTED, SEVERELY! DONT GET ME WRONG, I WILL STILL BUY DENTED GOODS, BUT ONLY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE. THE DAMAGE DID NOT OCCUR IN TRANSIT EITHER WHICH DISTURBS ME. IF THEY KNOW THEY ARE SELLING DENTED CANS, FINE, BUT START A SCRATCH AND DENT SECTION!!!!!! The fresh tasting Libbys Organic Corn, no additives! I cant believe Amazon can offer such good tasting corn in a can so cheap! But for taste and value, this cant be beat. This was a very good price for bulk ordering. However my order was part of some gift bags we were putting together for 8th graders. There was never intent to resell these. Due to ordering limitations, I was unable to order all 300 packs from here. I was shocked to see that the bulk version of these Jelly Bellys are just in a cardboard box, no plastic, no nothing. Doesnt seem overly hygienic. Since I didnt open the box for a few months the Jelly Bellys were getting softer and crystallizing [unbeknownst to me] because we live in a wet climate. Hmmm...just be aware that the packaging should be upgraded I paid extra money to have this overnighted to my sister, and it turns out it arrived more than a day late. Thats unacceptable to me. I love these delicious mangoes but the subscription option doesnt ship at correct times. I just received two shipments at once (even packaged in the same box) this week, when one of those shipments was supposed to be for April and I was not notified of that before they shipped and charged my card. This item didnt have the pleasant taste that most of Hodgson Mills products have, such as the Wild Blueberry Muffin Mix.  However, I found it greatly improved the flavor & added nutrition if I grated an apple into the mix. It increased the much needed moisture, & it was certainly a nutritious breakfast. Im dieting, and I use these as a \"treat\" to myself, when Im craving chocolate.  I usually brew one of these & one of my coffee K-cups (either plain or hazelnut).For 60 calories, its not a bad way to satisfy a chocolate craving when youre on a \"calorie-budget!\" This product is not sweet enough for me and tastes better with marshmellows already in the cup while brewing. Watery texture was a disappointment. I was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews, but its nothing special. For my taste, its way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough (even my kids agree). It reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish, so if that sounds good to you, go for it. But if youre more interested in something more spicy, hot and even a little sour, you might want to keep looking. These are very large bottles. It is a good dipping sauce with a sweet/spicy flavor. Panda has good flavor but the texture and shape is not the best. It does not have enough chew and I find it a bit dry. I much prefer RJs with its big solid tubes and excellent natural licorice flavor and satisfying, just right chew without being gummy. Ive found a new licorice,,this one is ok.,But I really dont need the extra sodium in my body.... The Melitta Java Pods Have a slightly smaller circumference than the Senseo pods and are thicker. If you are using a Senseo coffee machine, you probably should moisten the Java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid. Otherwise, you risk breaking the latching mechanism. The resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the Senseo decaf pods. The Melitta Java pods are not really designed for the Senseo machine and several other brands such as Halo, Fratello and Millstone work better in the Senseo machine. Some issues with the product -- some of the pods are not sealed properly so the grounds spill out (either before use or after use into your coffee); it is wasteful that each pod is individually sealed -- would rather they be packaged like the Senseo pods; the pods dont really fit my Senseo coffee maker -- too fat for the single and too small for the double which causes problems sometimes when I brew a cup.  On the plus side -- price. Melitta pods are full flavored; however, they do not fit my senseo coffee machine.  One pod in a two pod holder is too small and two pods are too large.  Sure do wish senseo was still readily available in the super markets! A decent, clean, and simple cup of morning decaf. I find pre-wetting the pod helps extract a little extra flavor. Parisian Cafe was not may favorite blend for breakfast coffee.  I prefer others of the Melitta brand. If youre used to Daves Insanity sauce, or like me youre used to Daves Ultimate Insanity sauce, youre going to be really disappointed. 5 of the 6 sauces arent spicy at all. Theyre probably at a spiciness level below Tobasco sauce. I tried really hard to like them but I just cant get over how watery and weak they are. The only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular Insanity sauce, but as I mentioned above, I prefer the Ultimate Insanity sauce. I guess I have plenty of salad dressings. I am a casual sauce user and the taste of these sauces was just OK.  Nothing special...  The insanity hot sauce was fun to try though.  I probably would not purchase again since they are pretty darn expensive. Ive been looking for a long time for a beer sausage that was hot to the taste that I use to enjoy back in the Deep South when I was a kid growing up. So far, Ive not been able to find the sausage that rang my bell. These arrived quickly and they are tasty and I am glad that I did order these, however, they are not as good as the ones I use to eat when I was in my teens.I gave the product a 3 star rating because they were tasty, but not what I was expecting. I know many of you will enjoy these and youll probably rate these as a 5 star item, but I must be honest to provide the best rating possible. The 3 stars were for the lack of qualilty in taste. They are not \"hot\" as one is led to believe. Hot makes you sweat, these do not. This roasted green tea was only \"so-so\" to my taste. Ive found others I like better since I purchased this. However, it arrived in a box of TWELVE boxes (each with 16 or so tea bags). Way too much! Then I found that we cant return food items, so I now have a LOT of tea. ...however, for the price and additional shipping cost (if not receiving that free), I would not say this is a such a good value. Not sure what makes the tuna more pricey than something like the freeze-dried salmon. If these were the only treats available to the cats, they likely would not last even one week in this small amount. In the future, Id be more apt to open up a 69-cent can of tuna, which they are just as fine with. The tea was a lot milder in flavor than I was expecting, but still pleasant. The aroma was light. I probably would not buy this again, but thats only because I would like a more intense flavor. Watch out for this because I wanted what was pictures however I got different colored flowers.  They use local vendors and it depends on what they have in stock.  The flowers still looked beautiful, but I was expecting the white and pink flowers.  My wife got orange and yellows one instead. I meant to pick up the normal Chewy Chips Ahoy and was flabbergasted when I returned home to find that they shoved the word \"oatmeal\" in the corner of the package but kept everything else the same. I decided to try them anyway and the oats definitely interrupt the normally wonderful chemistry between the chocolate and dough.[...] Skinless sardines in water differ from the ones with skin in oil in that they are somewhat coarse and dense as opposed to the softer texture of sardines in oil.  Not much fishy odor and the liquid is flavorful. Icicle is a pretty good preamp for the price.Very easy setup and a cool design, but definitely was not very rigid. Its very light and made of plastic.But the one things that I didnt like was the noise. It had a fair amount of buzz along with it.A cheap preamp for the price, but you get what you pay for. The level from this unit was hard to adjust, and when all was said and done, it was very low. It does record with ease and decent quality for the price. The only problem is it acts as a sound card and you cant record and listen to yourself at the same time without latency. This is a deal breaker for me. Blue microphones should add a headphone jack onto the interface so you dont have to listen to recordings through your computer and you can hear your recordings in real time. Never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal. Just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings. For the price paid, its very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired. Overall, I can not recommend this product at the current price its sold at. 15 to 20 dollars, then sure. Still, its an OK product. it is what is is... and it did the job that it was made for. lasts long if u take care of it but is easily out grown when just starting ur own studion I bought this device and use a brand new sure 52 with it.The noise and feedback I received with this device was horrible - I might have a bad unit.When I called customer service, a real person answered right away and offered to expedite getting me a new unit. (Very cool and is why I gave them 3 stars for now)Ill see how that process goes and update my review. Shipping: Ordered on a Sunday of Week 1.  Placed in box on a Friday of Week 2. Received it Wednesday of Week 3. Whoevers responsible for shipping (Amazon or Blue) took their sweet time to drop it in this 8\"x5\" box.Product: Currently testing the converter with a Shure PG58. Gain is incredibly low and a annoying tone when recording. I do believe the product is in working condition; too bad I have to figure out how to edit the hardware properly. The first brand of GF pancake mix I attempted was Bobs Red Mill and I loved it. I went to the store to try to find it again and this was all they had so I tried it. Its... okay. Im egg-free too and used mushed banana instead, so maybe that contributed to the slight mushy texture but I made a batch of egg ones for my in-laws and they said it was a bit mushy too.Its not horrible, but I prefer BRM brand personally. I was disappointed when I tried this pancake mix. Before going gluten free, Bisquick was our go-to pancake mix, so I had high expectations for the gluten free mix. The texture was a little weird. Soft and dry. I prefer the Pamela pancake mix over this one. This mix makes GREAT belgian waffles.  We tried biscuits and pancakes and we do far better form scratch with a standard GF flour.  It does make seriously great waffles though, and we go GF/DF on these.  The waffles freeze extremely well and reheat in the toaster quite nicely. It is good. I prefer the taste of baking mixes from scratch, but for store bought, its pretty good. Much cheaper in local grocery stores. Under $5 per box at my local stores in Chicagoland area. Rice flour, Sugar, Leavening ( baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified potato starch, salt, xanthan gum, MAY INCLUDE SOY INGREDIENTS The only complaint I have about the product is the price and I wish it were organic as well.  Other than that its a great, versatile mix.  Ive used it for pancakes and cherry cobbler : ). I love this mix. My favorite of any Ive tried. The only reason I starred it at 3 is because this is not a deal. I can get 3 boxes at Walmart for less than 12 dollars but I have heard of some places seriously over pricing it in other states so YMMV. Having recently been placed on a gluten free regime, I felt I needed some quick and easy help to get me started. It works great but is way too expensive for what it is. There were just over three cups of bisquick in the box. When I read the ingredients, I realized I could quickly mix up my own quick bread flour and keep it in the fridge. Im glad I tried this item because it taught me that I could do just as well on my own and save a great deal of money. ...this mix does have that grainy texture found with a lot of rice-based gluten-free mixes. The mix works well when the directions are followed and it is fairly versatile.I will use the mix I have, but Im not sure if this will be a staple in my pantry. Im not finding myself reaching for it on a regular basis, which is usually a sign that this isnt a hit in my household. I bought this immediately after finding out I could no longer have gluten. From everything I was reading it seemed daunting to mix different flours to make anything.The boxes are SMALL!  While this mix is okay for making pancakes, the biscuits are alright, and to use it as a coating chicken fingers is eh, Im glad I bought it when I was first diagnosed.  It helped ease my transition into gluten free cooking and baking.Now that I know what Im doing, I will not buy again.  Its much cheaper to make my own flour mixes at home and use those to make pancakes, biscuits, and breaking for chicken fingers.  And my own mix tastes much better.  But, if you are new to gluten free, definetly pick this up, it will help with the transition! The Bisquick Gluten Free was okay, but inferior to the Bobs Red Mill and Hodgson Mill products. Pancake batter, when made according to directions, was watery, resulting in flat pancakes. Alittle bit expensive for the product I think that it should be the same price as the non gluten Bisquick, and otherwise its good. My parents fell in love with San Francisco Bay Coffee Company coffee, which use to be available at our local AZ Costco. For christmas I looked every where for this coffee & found what I thought was a great value on Amazon. When I bought it (12/21/11) there was \"No Image Available\", should have been my first warning sign. They had lots of pictures of the 12oz bags of coffee from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Co, but I wanted something bigger, and this was 2 lbs. Now there is a picture availble, but if you look closely its \"Rogers Family Company\" coffee, who is technically located near the San Francisco Bay Area. So if youre in love with San Francisco Bay Coffee Company, dont buy this coffee. But on the upside, since I waited till the last minute to buy it, I gave it to my parents for christmas anyway & explained what happened, but they said the coffee was pretty decent. So still makes a nice cup of coffee, just not San Francisco Bay Coffee Company coffee. I have two medium-sized dogs, and these are a real bargain, but only keep them busy for about 15 minutes. Next time I will get the larger size. I found the candy to be harder than I had expected.  It came in bar form and it is rather hard to chew but just as tasty--just takes more chewing to enjoy!! While I love Bit a Honey and dont regret my purchase, I did not find them as \"fresh and soft\" as the other reviewers. They arrived hard and brittle but still taste wonderful if you can eat them without breaking your teeth. Maybe its because I bought the bags of individually wrapped Bit a Honeys as opposed to the actual candy bars. Next time its the bars! Berries are find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor. The flavor is very mild.  We tried brewing longer and using cooler water temp but the flavor is almost nonexistant.  Would not purchase again. Im not a coffee expert, but I know a good tasting coffee when I drink a cup. The Melitta Riviera is a light roast, with a nutty and creamy flavor. The aroma is just exhilarating. It left a nice aroma throughout the house, almost made it seem like I was in a coffee shop. Unfortunately, it is just decaffeinated and did not give me the jolt I need in the morning.The packaging caused some problems for me. The seal is excessively tight. Ive never had this problem with Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Peets Coffee, or Meijer packs. With the Melitta, it was so tight that when I did open it, the bag tore apart and spilled a lot of the ground coffee onto my kitchen top and floor. One could argue that this tight seal packs in all the flavor, I could argue that if it were easier to open I wouldnt have spilled maybe 3 days worth of coffee grounds onto the floor.Pros: Light roast, excellent aroma, nutty and creamy tasteCons: Decaf (arggghhh) and hard to open packOverall: 3/5 I have a pretty wide appreciation for acceptable coffee, but in my opinion, this stuff is mediocre coffee. I drink both regular and decaf on a daily basis and to me, this tasted like institutional cafeteria coffee. I am normally a fan of the \"Swiss water decaffeination process\" decaf coffees, and was disappointed by the quality of this \"gourmet\" coffee.With that said, I did try this twice to give it a fair review. The first time I prepared it the same way I normally make my coffee (on the strong side), the second time I followed the directions exactly. Both times using filtered water and a quality coffee maker that uses the Melitta style (cone) filter. To my taste, it was stale and over-ground (like the flavor was watered out of it and then over-roasted and ground extra fine to try and put some flavor back into it), comparable in quality to low-end bulk coffee. The brands of decaf coffee I do like and brew at home (Dunkin and Newmans Own, to name only two) are in the same price range, and also purchased pre-ground, but to me taste much smoother, and more full-flavored. This coffee is not one I would make a point to purchase when there are better coffee choices for the same money -or cheaper coffee choices for the same quality. The price is great but I just didnt like the taste of this coffee. Im pretty picky about coffee and love to drink strong. This one produce very acidic coffee when made strong, but if you make it thin, then it tastes okay with just slight acidic after taste. How youd like this coffee is really depending on your personal taste of coffee, but if you are like me, drink coffee strong, or dislike acidic after taste that lasts while, then this is not for you. I thought this would be a great decaf option, but the flavor is a lot milder than expected. I use a bit more than the recommended amount to coax more intense flavor. A bit better than instant for late night sippers like me. I remembered that Melitta was a very fine ground, and thought it would likely go well in my coffee maker.But after having a bag of whole beans and grinding it myself, the Melitta came up average at best.  Better than Maxwell House though. This ground decaffeinated coffee makes a fine brew with a rich aroma and flavor. It is smooth and satisfying with a full-bodied taste. My wife and I loved the taste and aroma of this ground coffee. For an ideal cup measure one heaping teaspoon full of coffee per cup of hot water. You could change the quantity depending on the strength of the coffee you desire. I generally drink decaffeinated Folgerss brand, and when I compared the two brands, I did not find a great deal of difference in the richness of coffee. You may want to consider the price variance between the two brands before you want to purchase this product. Not much of a decaf drinker (unless I am craving a cup late night for some reason). I have to say, this coffee tasted average at best. I am a WAWA coffee fan, and coming from them to this.. well it missed the mark. I gave some to my mother in law and she seemed happy with it, so 3 stars in that respect. I might try mixing it with my non-decaf coffee to see how it tastes, but I am not holding my breath. If the price was a few $$ cheaper, definitely would bump it up a star. If you are truly looking for a decaf that will no longer make your heart race, this is not the coffee for you. It is quite flavorful, so I do recommend it to those who can still tolerate a bit of kick in their coffee. Like most Melitta brews, I found this one to be somewhat middle of the road.  Its certainly not undrinkable, but its not the first one Id reach for, either.  As many of the other reviewers mentioned, I did find it nearly undrinkable when brewed in the quantity shown; I think you have to at least double the amount you use to get a good cup, so take that into consideration when figuring the value.Im a little sensitive to caffeine and like to have a decaf on hand for drinking later in the day, and I bought this primarily to use with my Mr. Coffee frappe maker (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G\">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a>; let me just put in a quick pitch for that, I love it!)  I found the \"Riviera Sunset\" stood up well to all the milk, flavoring, and ice inherent in making a frappe (again, with a significant increase in the amount used).I would probably not purchase this coffee just because of my own views on coffee; I look for bird-friendly, Fair Trade brands, and I find nothing to indicate that Melitta makes any effort to meet these expectations.  Leaving aside these considerations, though, I think those who enjoy a somewhat light, easy-drinking brew would like this coffee. Okay, Im a complete coffee nut: Ive even been known to grow my own beans, and when I run out of my private label, I tend to enjoy the baddest Kona or Jamaican Blue Mountain I can find.Still, sometimes I just want a quick cup of respectable coffee without all the fuss, and this is what I was hoping for in the Melitta Riviera decaf. To a good degree, I was happy with it, but its certainly not something Id curl up with when in the mood for a really outstanding cup of coffee.The positives are the aroma, the uniformity of the grind and the overall taste, which Id rate as fairly mild and maybe a slight bit on the acid side. I found I liked it best either in a French press or in my Viviano espresso maker - two techniques that make the most out of somewhat weak coffee. Brewed conventionally, I found I could compensate by using somewhat more coffee than usual.Still, although not a serious competitor to the worlds best coffees, it doesnt cost $50 a pound, either. Id have to say that for the price, its definitely worth trying. Im not sure what all the fuss is about???  I thought it was a good coffee but not better than the store brand I usually  buy.  ..and beings the store brand is much cheaper... Ill stick with it.  It isnt bad coffee but I just dont seeing it being any better.. This makes a good pot of decaf.  Nothing remarkable - we have served this to many guests to no comments.  Nobody asked us what it was, but nobody spit it out, either :-).  It is smooth and not too strong, which is our preference.  We wouldnt hesitate to buy it again, but wouldnt go out of our way either. The coffee is good but it is nothing special. Compared to Maxwelhouse decafe this is nearly the same just slightly better. I dont feel it is worth the extra cash to buy this instead of a cheaper variety available anywhere. I did enjoy the coffee but I probably wont buy it again unless it would be deeply discounted. First of all, when I opened my bag of Melitta decaf, it didnt have that strong, amazing rich coffee smell that my usual coffee has.  I brewed up a pot in my drip coffeemaker, and while it was ok, there was nothing outstanding about the taste.  It was bland and unremarkable compared to the coffee I normally drink. The aroma of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4\">Melitta Cafe Collection Riviera Sunset Decaffeinated Ground Coffee, 10-Ounce Bags)</a> was fairly weak. Scent, after all, is a huge part of taste, and this was disappointing.Even though I added more coffee grinds than the directions instructed, I found the coffee to be a bit bland. The taste was more than flavored water, but not amazingly so, with no subtle overtones. It wasnt bitter, but it wasnt much of anything.While I generally drink hi-test as opposed to decaffeinated, I do drink decaf at least twice a week. The <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4\">Melitta</a> was comparable to the generic brand that I usually have.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4\">Melitta Cafe Collection riviera Sunset Decaf</a> isnt a bad coffee, but its not worth the money if there are other options available. Decaffeinated coffee is for most an oxymoron, for others an afterthought. It possesses few spots on grocery shelves and has shared little in the \"gourmet\" coffee line which changed how people accept this ancient drink into their lives. Comedian Bob Irwin even compared the blend to \"kissing your sister.\" The days first cup comes with a sense of entitlement; subsequent cups transition through the day (work, afternoon, dessert), while wanting both coffees jolt and cozy sociability. (Instant? Dont get me started!)Thats why this new Melitta Riviera Sunset gourmet coffee is a pleasant surprise. It carries a full, almost nutty flavor without the bitter bite of the coffee which, for many, defines their image of coffee and its lifestyle. (This isnt surprising since Melittas ad copy references the breezy feel of European cafes, a far cry from the irked lines at the morning coffee shop.)No less than Henry Ward Beecher once said. \"No coffee can be good in the mouth that does not first send a sweet offering of odor to the nostrils.\"  Riviera Sunset invites with its scent upon opening and doesnt disappoint when poured.(Hold to the preparation instructions; yours truly made one cup a little too strong and it came across a bit acidic.) Its taste, not its caffeine jolt, is your wake-up call. Recommended as a tastier, if somwhat pricier, alternative to major brands. Im not a coffee snob.  I can tell that there is a difference between Kenyan and Columbian, but I cant tell you which is which without a label.  This decaf tastes good.  I like mine with lots of fake sugar and cream; the coffee flavor isnt subdued by these additions.  The bag ultimately required scissors to open.  The blurb for this says \"(pack of 3)\"; I only got one bag.  Not sure why that is; its happened before with other products.  Would I buy this again?  Sure, if it was on sale . . . thats how I buy my coffee most of the time. First off, I received a bag of this coffee via the Vine Program to review at no cost.  Secondly, I am more of a bold, \"slap-me-in-the-face\" French Roast coffee drinker (or StarBucks Gold Coast), so I had my reservations about this decaf.And ... Well, for me, this coffee had a somewhat stale aroma upon opening the package, an OK flavor once brewed (sort of a nutty strange flavor at first), and once consumed, left an after-taste in my mouth.It is definitely a different roast than I am used to, but it is \"decent\" for a pre-ground Melita decaf.  More of a medium roast as opposed to being a dark bold roast in my opinion.  Overall ... not too bad.I give this coffee a so-so recommendation. I usually enjoy a cup of coffee a few days a week, more as an indulgence than as a necessity.  Its a sipping beverage for me, and flavor matters a lot.  That said, I add milk and sugar, so Im not excessively picky (or I think so, at least).  So Im always glad to find new \"gourmet\" blends to add to my list of favorites.This blend seemed promising, with a very nice aroma and a perfect, even grind.  I usually grind my own beans, but found that this grind worked nicely in my espresso machine as-is.  It even produced a rich, smooth crema.  Unfortunately, my first sip - without sugar or milk - was very bitter.  I ended up adding about a half-teaspoon more sugar than I usually use just to compensate.  Even then, the coffee flavor, itself, was thin and weak.  With just a little milk added, it tasted more like, well, flavored milk.This coffee reminded me of the inoffensive bland coffee my parents used to get for our drip coffee maker a couple of decades ago.  Fine for that application, but not really what Im looking for in rich, smooth flavor with low bitterness. This coffee tastes better than Folgers. Thats not much of an endorsement, but since Folgers is about all I ever drink, its my only point of comparison. I would recommend you dont try the stupid and counterproductive experiment of replacing your usual caffeinated stuff with a cup of this some Saturday morning, as doing so will only result in one of those headaches it takes three over-the-counter painkillers to get rid of. And in the meantime, while youre trying to fight off the headache, youll be completely unable to make headway with that craptastic novel you just got from Amazon, which was reinforcing all your worst opinions of the romantic fantasy subgenre before you had to lie down and commence clutching your forehead. Normally I would not purchase coffee online as I have several coffee shops within a reasonable distance.  I saw this and figured \"why not?\"This coffee was vacuumed sealed and was tight enough to where I had to use scissors to open it.  One thing I tend to avoid is pre-ground coffee.  I usually like to grind my own beans as I find the taste is better.The smell from the bag was for a lack of better words pretty basic.  Usually, there is a distinct smell depending on the bean and there can be faint traces of something.  There wasnt anything distinct about this coffee.I used a standard drip maker which in itself was probably not the best choice but I suspect it would not matter as I was surprised that there really isnt a strong smell coming from the cup of coffee which I drank black.The taste was kind of bland.  I did try a little piece of chocolate and it did seem to help.Overall its an ok coffee if you are not an aficionado.  However, its not something I would add to my list of brands I purchase. I am amazed at the consistent flavor of Melitta coffees. Seriously, I sip any Melitta coffee and can identify it immediately as they all taste the same. Not bad coffee, always a darker roast and a deep flavor, but always the same no matter what flavor is printed on the package. The Riviera Sunset makes a nice rich cup of decaf coffee, perfect for an after dinner treat. Melitta Cafes Riviera sunset coffee isnt bad, it just sadly isnt all that great either.  It is not something I would buy again, mainly because Ill probably forget about it. This is part of Dr. Ozs Tea Diet. Works like a charm. I have lost inches already and I have been on it for 4 days. I ordered in order to get variety of flavored coffees, and have to admit disappointed in the selection. Several duplicates of ordinary coffees received. Also 2 of the flavors advertised which were my primary reason for ordering were not included. I was very excited to recieve my shipment today then to be disapppointed because 2 of the flavors that I was told would be in the package were not there! I really wanted to try Creme Brulee and Raspberry Chocolate truffle!  I am looking forward to trying the others but had I know I would not receive these flavors I would not have ordered this product!  I also did not recieve the Pink Ribbon flavor! Pkg says soy free. Ingredients (and my stomach/bladder) say otherwise!Also, lots of fiber in this one. If you can handle fiber (and soy) this food will fill you up like crazy. If you have IBS and have trouble with fiber,or are eating a low residue diet be careful....Im going back to the bread. Eating a sandwich on it grilled is a fair substitute for the dreaded wheat... Berries are find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor. Ive been sampling as many sugar-free chocolates as I can find.  This one was okay but not the best.  I dont think what I got was the freshest either, as it had some of that white coating on a portion of the bar.  The BEST Ive found so far is Cavalier brand at another website. I keep these in the freezer when unexpected guests drop-in, or if one of the staff has guests.  What we do prefer is to slaughter the fatted calf, but that is not always practical due to anticipating aging times.  Having just said that, I realize that I must institute a detailed and precise slaughtering schedule to insure always having quality beef on hand.I may have given these Kobe steaks four stars if that were my only gripe, but I have a problem with  the size.  First off, these cuts are only one inch thick, which is ghastly offensive.  I steak should be, at the bare minimum, two inches thick.  I do not even associate with proletarians, and can only imagine the horrors that these \"people\" committ against decent food.  Cant these people just eat sensibly, or not at all.  Please dont get me started, for I wanted to include sterility drugs in all fast food, particularly the bargain menu, but that is merely a hope and dream for another day.Secondly, isnt there a law somewhere about a steak less that  two pounds?  My heavens, this fourteen ouncer is a mere sampler, a tease.  I suppose these cuts are intended to be given away at those offensive stores that the yuppies flock to as lemmings to a cliff.Lastly, I must close this review before I become too distraught. The set is bigger than I thought it would be.  It would take a very big cake to set up all of this.  I ended up using only the golfer and a ball.  The golfer is about 3 inches tall and the clubs are 3-4 inches long. My dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food.  After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T-Bone steak flavor).  I guess it looks and tastes more like \"people food\" than the other varieties.  My only complaint is that when I received the shipment (pack of 24), almost all of the cans were dented, and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can.  One can leaked out - the dent was at the seal on the top.  Normally, Im not someone who is picky about dented cans, but this was a little much.  A couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when I opened them.  So, I guess Ill go back to buying at the grocery store.  Just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store.  Oh well..... My dogs love this food! No allergies, more energy and nicer coats. My big dogs skin doesnt seem nearly as irritated and I am assuming with a little more use his skin will be normal again. We like it m2 ofore than any other I have seen. My only problem is that I have 2 dogs one huge one and 12.5lbs hardly make it a month. We really could use bigger bags or a qty discount. Plus I cannot find this in any stores so when I ran out I had to by a substitute...UPDATE: My second shipment did not arrive at all. i have been trying to contact buyer but I cannot figure it out... Had to go back to the old food at least I realize that this food did not help with the dry itchy skin that the dogs have.. :{ Ive been searching for a no-corn natural dog food to keep skin rashes away...tried Halo which was great but so expensive.  This is a little more affordable and the ingredient list looks very similar to Halo, but....oh boy.  Im just glad its warm enough to have the windows open!  My dog loves the taste and the quality seems great, so well try 2 more days to see if things settle down. I dont know why this got such good reviews but my Yorkshire really doesnt like it. He likes Iams more than this and its cheaper. I guess my animals (cat and dog) cant read the amous names on bag warpings, as they almost refuse to eat this stuff unless nothing else available and they are hungry. I really want to like this product because of the great things Newmans have done and the fact that all the proceeds go to charity. I like the fact that the ingredients are all top quality and organic. It looks and smells good too. Unfortunately, none of this matters to my dog Daisy. She just doesnt care for it. Usually she will sniff it and walk away. Once she realizes nothing else is coming her way she will usually eat it but I feel bad since she obviously doesnt care for it. Like I said, I really want to like this product, but my dog has the final say. Sadly, I dont think I will buy it again. I like that this is a reasonably priced organic dog food that is readily available. I switched to this when the brand I had been feeding my dogs for years began to upset the tummy of my senior. However, neither of my dogs (even my \"chowhound\") is crazy about it. They eventually did eat it, but it took a lot of coaxing. But the tummy problems did clear up. I have three dogs.  Two of the three would normally eat just about anything that you put in their bowls.  The third one (a Yorkie), has always been pickey. For the past couple years I had been buying those expensive brands of food that promise \"natural ingredients and better health\". I decided to try Newmans Own.  None of my dogs seem to be crazy about this food (no disrespect to the late Mr. Newman).  If I mix Newmans Own with another brand, the dogs make an effort to pick out (eat) the \"other\" food and they will tend to leave Newmans Own in the bowl.  If they are hungry and nothing else is available, they will eat the Newmans Own. I am not here to \"knock\" Newmans Own.  I am simply telling you my experience. BTW: The food is not old. It does not smell stale or old. This solved my pups dog food allergy problems when I started purchasing it (I have a husky and a german shepherd), but several months ago the itching started again; the color and size of the kibble even noticeably changed. I wrote a letter of inquiry to Newmans, with batch numbers from the bags, but have received no answer. Since then, Ive purchased both Solid Gold Wolf King and Royal Canine 24 German Shepherd and the dogs are doing okay again. My dog LOVES this food.  I really like that it is organic, especially with all the recent problems with other dog foods.  I will continue to buy this brand in the store.  I would rate the product as a 5.The problem I had was with subscribe and save.  I started out buying at a very decent price.  After only 2 months the subscription price had increased by almost 40%!!  No notice on the increase was sent to see if I still wanted it either.  I believe Amazon should send an alert and ask to confirm or cancel when there is an increase.  My other subscriptions have not had price increases like this one.  Subscription rating-- 1. Tastes very good.  I really like the taste.But then it is gone.  Like it was never there.  So fleeting.Takes two pieces to really enjoy, also.And be VERY careful not to eat it.  Seriously, it is hard not to swallow it.  Laugh all you want.  You try it and see what I mean. I thought this would be the perfect candybar, I love hazel nuts, I love caramel, and I love chocolate.  But there is something about the chocolate filling that I dont like.  they claim a whole hazel nut in each piece, but its probably only half.  Its an OK candy, but I will never ever buy it again. Ill stick to Snickers with almonds! We have been experimenting with different brands of K-Cups since we purchased our Keurig last Christmas.  While this one was okay, it just is not as good Green Mountains Breakfast Blend for an everyday staple.  We havent tried Green Mountain Columbian yet as a closer comparison.  However, when we make a larger cup of coffee with this one, the brew is noticibly weaker than with GM Breakfast Blend.Also, please note that we LOVE Timothys World Italian Blend!!  It is definitely amount our favorites. Ive suffered from recurrent bouts of acute sinusitis that have only become worse and worse over the years. Every time I get an infection, my right maxillary sinus swells up like a balloon. Sleeping at night on account of this condition is terribly difficult; I often have to resort to using Afrin to decongest my sinuses, which is effective but also very painful and not a realistic, long term solution because of rebound congestion. Now I already irrigate with a motorized system, often upwards of 8-10X daily when Im sick, and drinking herbal tea has also become a pasttime to help cope with my sinus disease. That being said, I bought this tea out of sheer desperation. Ill try (and have tried) next to anything to give myself some relief while I wait for antibiotics to take effect. The only thing which I find works even close to as well as Afrin is to megadose on Psuedoephedrine (240 1-2 times per day), which is something that is also unsustainable. So, keep in mind that the severity of my sinus condition is drastic. What I found with this tea is that it seems to help, but I cant tell whether or not it works any better than domestic teas that tout similar claims (Yogis Breathe Deep and Cold Buster, Celestial Sleepytime Sinus Soother, and other respiratory-aiding herbal formulations). Ive brewed it double-strong to try and gain the greatest effect, and again, it seems to work modestly but nothing amazing. The taste is a little bitter, but I suppose thats a fairly reasonable indicator it has beneficial compounds in it. All in all, I am likely to stick with the less exotic teas that I can buy at the grocery store. As an aside, I find Celestials Sweet and Spicy herbal mix to have probably the best mucus thinning effect out of all the teas Ive tried, though its not at all marketed as something for this purpose. If you read everything they put in it, though, it makes sense that it would help. Buffalo Bills Premium SnacksI realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought Id share my thoughts on these products.First, customer service is excellent.  Ive always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.So far Ive ordered the following products:1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short ShotsThe first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jims, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per bag.3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra SmokeysThese are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random sizeTaste great if you are a jerky lover.5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short ShotsProbably the closest to Slim Jims of all the short shots6) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey StrungO.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesnt care much for them either.All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.Gunner  January, 2010 Tried Mild Only.Amazon $28 on 02/12/2012ProGood weight price value.ConMushy (was hoping it would be drier & firmer like other reviews stated).No Snap to skin.So So Flavor.HOT Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Short Shots taste good & have better texture.Also better price/weight ratio.  Smaller peices means better portion control. Six Hour Power does help to create a more energetic and alert state.  The affect does not last anywhere near six hours.  For me it was a couple of hours.  It is not as strong as Five Hour Power high strength, but it is not positioned as high strength either.  For the money, I would buy this again over the regular Five Hour Power product. My husband works outside all day long. Due to the recent heatwave, his body is depleted of fluids due to sweat. My husband uses the energy shot along with ZipFizz. The ZipFizz provides the necessary potassium to keep the body going. I personally do not recommend too many energy shot drinks during the day, but they do prove beneficial to help you keep going. The wrappers are GOOD but it would have been easier if the filling was already in them.  The fact that it wasnt meant I had to lookup what goes into a wrapper and buy water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and bean sprouts to help me make up my own filling.  Thewrappers are GOOD but more work than heating up a frozen appetizer. The cookies came sealed and seem to be high quality in there ingredients.  The only thing is they just dont taste that good. My girlfriend and I thought these might be a good dessert-like option while doing the Paleo diet, but after trying one of each kind over a couple days we just dont find ourselves going back for more.  I would much rather not have a dessert and really check that box on a cheat day than being left wanting more after eating these.  If you have a true gluten allergy, maybe this is a good option for you but Im not a believer. barbaras yogurt bars are okay.  i found the whole grain bar very dry and there really isnt much blueberry, or for that matter, apple flavors.  on the positive side, the bar is a soft chew.  total carbs 29g.  its an okay bar in the glut of cereal bars to choose from at the grocery store. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6BCC\">Royal Oak  Gourmet Virginia Raw In Shell Peanuts, 2.5 Pound Bags (Pack of 3)</a>Ill appreciate your speedy deliver of my package, however you sent me raw peanuts without the shell.  This item is going into a gift basket for my Pastor because he love raw peanuts in a shell.  I dont have time to returned them for the requested product. You have always been prompt with my orders in the past and I really do appreciate.  This is the first time you sent me an incorrect product.  Ill make it work. I like that these are organic and dont have corn syrup.  My kids and I both like them.  Id give them 5 stars but I noticed earlier this year that they changed the recipe.  The crackers are lighter and flakier than they used to be and they break more easily.  And if you have kids under 5, you might understand how upsetting broken crackers can be.  The taste is still great, but I preffered the old texture myself and definitely for my kids who cry when the crackers break while they are eating them.  And when you order these in the mail, like I did last time, dont expect many full graham cracker sheets - most are already broken in two, and quite a few are broken at the edges as well. These crackers are terrific, and they are priced right.  However, i ordered them on 10/29/06, and the expiration date on the box was 12/31/06.  We have only eaten four boxes.  They still taste fine after the expiration date, but... am i really expected to consume 12 boxes in 2 months? If you love vegetable soup you should like this. Yes it has come chicken and large noodle type items in it too.But it was not as good as I expected or hoped it would be I enjoyed this soup.  It was flavorful with a nice blend of spices.  I will buy it again. These are not awful if eaten with a cup of tea, coffee or milk -- but they are very dry if eaten plain.  I do like how they have less sugar than most granola bars and are not a choking hazard for toddlers like hard snacks can sometimes be.  I am a fan of the oatmeal raisin mini cookies, and of the regular size EB cookies, but this flavor tastes very fruity to me and not very chocolaty.  I think the double choc cherry tastes better than these.  Happy to have them for last resort snack-on-the-go needs, but not my favorite. I started out thinking they were OK, a little more substance than the breakfast bar from Whole Foods.  But after I ordered a 12-pack (I didnt realize it was 12 boxes of 8), and had eaten them for a couple of weeks as I was flying out the door, I realized they were not really very tasty and kind of dry. Ive been on the hunt for high quality, yet affordable cat food for my little ones the past few months. I decided to order a case of Felidae (along with a case of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK8B8W\">Pet Guard Fish, Chicken & Liver Food for Cats</a>). Well, they love the Petguard but absolutely hate the Felidae, all three of them sniffed/licked it and looked at me like \"youre kidding..right?\" Even mixing in some of their old food and gradually trying to change them over wouldnt work, theyd sniff it and walk off.They LOVE the Petguard though and will inhale it the second I put it on their plates, so at least I discovered one good food theyll eat. I guess Ill donate the 8 cans of Felidae I have left to the local shelter. Despite the fact my cats wouldnt eat it I still gave it 3 stars because it IS a great quality food...if your cats will eat it. My cats arent usually picky and Ive had them on Natural Balance Venison grain free canned and dry food but one still has digestive problems (probably from ten years of eating \"junk\" kitty food) so I keep trying to find a food that will help to heal him. I tried Felidae and he and one other cat eats it, but the other two dont. I do believe one is extremely picky because he wont eat Halo brand either but loves the Natural Balance and Taste of the Wild grain free options. I hate having to buy so many different brands to please my four cats! Also - this says 95% protein derived from fish - so maybe they are having a distaste for the fish? Its too bad because they do love tuna but it causes the sick one to vomit every time. Oh well, its a another miss in our family. First off, my cats loved the food. One of them has had issues in the past and I need to be careful with what I feed him, and this seems to work well. However, about half the cans were your normal, semisolid cat-food consistency, and the other half were incredibly runny and nasty looking. They ate both kinds with equal gusto so I dont think anything was wrong with it, per se, but I still found it a little concerning. Im ordering another batch, and well see how that turns out. I gave it 3 stars because of the quality ingredients. But if neither of my cats will eat it, whats the use? We tried weaning them to this food from the junk weve been feeding them by mixing and slowly increasing the amount of Felidae, or by getting them real hungry first, all to no avail. The only way theyll eat it is if we cover it with drippings from fish we cook for ourselves, or from cans of sardines.More than anything, I think the mushy pate type texture bothers them more that the taste, because it smells pretty good to me. Wonderful ingredients list but the peas are whole. If I dont mush them several of my cats just eat around them.The cats & I all prefer the regular Felidae formula and its a little cheaper, too. I was drinking Yuban Organic medium roast coffee until I could not find it anymore at my local grocery store so I tried this instead.  What a let down after drinking the organic coffee.  This just tastes like average grocery store coffee comparable to Folgers but the organic stuff, now thats a different story. That stuff is good. Tastes damn near as good as the fresh stuff you can buy at Dunn Bros or Caribou coffee houses.  Dont believe me try both this and the organic version side by side.  You wont go back to this again I promise you that if you have any coffee sense at all. I Wish They Hadnt Changed the Formula for the Yuban that was sold up until about 2 years ago. I even contacted General Foods and asked why they had reformulated their coffee and they told me they were going back to their \"original\" formula from many years ago. Why? They had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market. Yuban was a special treat. Now it is just ordinary. I still like it for everyday coffee, but it sure isnt what it used to be. Formerly, I even preferred it to Starbucks, but no more. This pub mix is really a cut above your average snack to be sure.  I tend to pick up a tub of it at the local Walmart here anytime I venture there.  The flavor of it is really hard to pin down.  Its sorta a salty, garlic/onion/whatever type of blend that truly works deliciously.  Im a self confessed snack-a-holic that has tried just about everything around, and personally I have not tasted anything that is quite like this blend.  Its really good with your favorite beer, or just by itself and I highly recommend it.  The only down side to this stuff is the price.  Which is not something usually cared about or taken into account with UTZ products, which tend to be very reasonably priced for the most part.  Unfortunately like a lot of things that are really good, this mix is not easily found locally.  I see it only at the local Walmart here in the small 20 oz size that carries a hefty price.  I buy it anyway on occasion for its so good, but make no mistake about it, its not cheap as snack chips go.  And unfortunately I do not recommend buying this mix on Amazon in any size.  Its way too expensive here for any deal currently being offered.  If you wanna try it or like it already, I suggest you search it out locally at your big department stores, (its never found in supermarkets round these parts), spring for the price, and grab an ice cold beer and enjoy... ; the problem with this mix -- and to mind, the only problem! -- is the inclusion of one or two slightly sugary little... things. This provides an experience of, well, repugnance, at least for me; Ive never been one to mix the sodium and the glucose, and this surely aint converting me. ESPECIALLY when theyre in the same bite/handful. Ugh.Otherwise, this mix is really yummy. It all tastes rather waxy, and Im sure is not the healthiest food in the world (though you could do worse), but its a well combined mixture.But then again, Ive got to sort of work my way through at a crawling pace, because I must grab a handful, and then separate the rejects. Maybe Im just neurotic, or maybe they made A FATAL MISTAKE AND SHOULD BE PUNISHED.Oh yeah, like the last reviewer, I too got em at Costco. Cat grass is cat grass, and I have one cat that absolutely loves it; another that couldnt care less.  Its winter now, so I couldnt find it where I buy seeds, so I went on line.  Product is okay, service was prompt.  My disappointment: could only order one two-ounce package per shipping and handling fee.  Cat grass only lasts a couple of weeks, and I would have ordered 3 or 4 packages, but not at 3 or 4 times that shipping fee! It was hard to grow but once it grew my cat loved it. I havent found any seeds that work well yet, but I am still looking. I would buy this again is=f I had better luck with growing it. My cat love this grass. Really easy to grow, only 3 days. Im not going to count the seeds but i dont think they are 500 seeds. Dont know why people want to step in cold cat vomit on their to the bathroom in the middle of night, but this will get the job done. Vomit stains carpets, beds, shirts. You will find hard, old fossilized vomit under beds occasionally too.  Entire rooms of carpet will need replacing.If you have all wood floors and love cat vomit, go for it.However, it is a beautiful decorative grass when potted on its own or mixed with herbs. Just keep out of cats reach. Good air freshener if you grow enough indoors.No idea why people want cat vomit indoors though.3 stars because it is wheat grass which can be bought in bulk much cheaper for couple bucks more. Just received a case of this tea.  It tastes good and a bit on the sweet side, but not overly sweet.  I would give it a higher and better rating if it is not made in China though. I enjoyed my 1st cup very much.  The aroma was heady and the flavor was pleasantly mild.  But, ultimately, it is too mild for my daily morning \"kick\". Ill be going back to my Lavazza mornings when this is gone. Not bad, but there are better gums than this one. At the beginning is a big explosion of flavor and sugar like sensation, but after 5 minutes is gone. If ever there was a gum to worry about having in your stomach for seven years (as the popular myth states), this one is the most likely. It tastes great, sure, but in the first few bites, it falls apart, losing any cohesiveness (gummyness), and just gets swallowed. For some reason, about 1/3 of it remains intact and becomes gum. What little remains is as the other reviewers state, but knowing that Ive swallowed more than half the sticks Ive chewed is not a pleasant thought. Initially, the flavor is fairly accurate, however weak- from there, the flavor diminishes rapidly. I just timed it, and this gum goes flat within 5 minutes.In light of my experience, I find these rave reviews somewhat... amusing; one reviewer even went as far as to describe it as \"incredibly tart\". Meh.Like many new products in the realm of gum, pop, energy drinks, and fast food, they only need you to buy one. If everyone does that, theyll be sitting pretty.Based on this experience, I have no desire to try the other flavors of Extra Dessert Delights.Three stars = Its OK, but doesnt live up to the hype. I thought I was doing my kid a favor when I invested in a case of Earths Best dinners.  Unfortunately, the second ingredient (after water) for all of these is....applesauce.  Or in the case of the \"Sweet Potato & Chicken\" variety, its sweet potatoes, followed by apricot puree.After getting used to the sweetness of these (try em - theyre like jam), its difficult for kids to adjust to \"real\" food.  From now on, Im going to stick with just pureeing home-cooked food.  Its a lot cheaper, too. To be honest, my baby didnt really love all of these at first. Hes pretty picky, so I had to mix fruit into some of these to get him interested in a few of them.  He took to the gourmet meals pack right away, but didnt love all of these.  But as hes gotten older, hes gotten less picky and seems to accept all of these flavors now without having to bribe him by mixing in fruit.  The prices on Amazon are good, so I will continue to order these here. I did like this product until some jars I found black mold on the inner lids.I read other reviews, but I thought it mustve been a bad batch.  I was wrong.Earths Best used to be very good. So I canceled my next Subscribe and Save order.  Then I feedback cancel reason to Amazon. LOVE earths best but my 8 mth old daughter only liked one of the 4 selections. i highly recommend buying just one of each from the store and having your baby test them before buying these in bulk. walmart usually has them for .60 each Our pediatrician told me to include some form of meat at dinner for our baby. Unfortunately, two of the four varieties dont include meat. I dont think Summer Vegetable should be included in a dinner variety pack, thats what the vegetable variety pack is for. Also, the chicken and sweet potato is extremely runny and hard to feed to a baby. 3 of the flavors are pretty good but the Sweet Potato & Chicken is pretty gross. I was wondering why my daughter didnt want to eat it until I tried it myself I like their variety package, but also heard that there is BPA in the lid. I will switch to other BPA free products. This is OK rice.  It cooks fairly well in my cooker, not as good as some other tho.  But the taste is really very earthy.  I dont mind that too much, but this is almost too strong tasting. I eat basamati brown rice quite often and found this to be relatively flavorless.It cooked very well in my rice cooker, but did not embody that wonderful nutty aroma and flavor.  The grains are finer and have less body than what I have enjoyed in other brands...maybe personal preference.  Would not try again. Its got the typical Jif taste, which to me is unremarkable -- its ... just peanut butter -- however, the single serve containers are convenient and transport well. The consistency is great -- its not runny yet its also not a solid hunk-a peanut butter with floating oil either. Good for dipping pretzels or celery/other veggies, and -- in the absence of a spreder -- you can just tear off the top and squuush the contents onto bread.The price is right. Good stuff, but may be a bit expensive in relation to more local products.  Love the no sugar added, but found product at local store for half the price.  Would continue to purchase if I did not have cheaper option. The cats dont like this flavor. I would have preferred an assortment of flavors. The product itself is good. I just have finicky cats. And I am weaning them off wet food, anyway. My older cat is getting too big! Notice I didnt say fat!  ;-) I first came across Lovers Leap Estate tea when buying it from Harney & Sons. I enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness, reminiscent of an Afternoon Darjeeling. The reason I went with the Elmwood Inn now was that Harney only sells this tea in tins and I wasnt interested in adding a tin to my collection every time I purchased this tea.Of course I cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but I must say that the Elmwood Inn fell short of my expectations. It tastes rather uninteresting and almost flat, and in order to get any kind of recognizable flavor, I have to use plenty of leaves. Yet it still never achieves any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over, lets say, loose Twinings for much less. I will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to Harneys Lovers Leap. Have you ever had a great-cup-of-joe from a freshly opened can of gourmet coffee, only to wonder what happened to that fresh taste as you dig deeper into the can? I have experienced this with other main stream brands but not with Yuban Original coffee! The last pot of coffee has always tasted as good as the first one. There is also a unique quality to this coffee that I have a fondness for. Of course, there will always be something better out there, but its usually at a higher price. Though the coffee is consistent, it is the wide price range ($0.18 - $0.40 / oz) of this coffee that keeps me at bay with a more cautious 3 stars.NOTE:With the \"Subscribe & Save\" option, you can trim costs and be assured of free shipping. Previously, I had subscribed to the 33 oz cans - right up until the option was discontinued by Amazon. I have since switched my subscription to this size and updated this review accordingly. The jar is much smaller than I imagined via pictures - I thought it was going to be the size of a mason jar, but it was instead much smaller. It is spicy though! Lots of jalapeno, not a lot of honey mustard! These Piquillos are packaged in a thin plastic package, though I thought from the picture that they were packed in a roll-top tin (like sardines are packed in).The peppers that survived the shipping were very good, lightly roasted and with good tangy flavor. However, one of the packages was damaged in shipment and leaked red oil all over the rest of the packs, making a huge mess. Its hard to put a *star rating on this.  I like the crackers a whole lot and think they are super.  They are hard to find in our local stores and I use Amazon a lot for good pricing and hard to locate items.  However, this purchase experience was a little disappointing.  The crackers came quickly and in great shape...no breakage and the price was fine.  But, when I opened the first box, I found they had weevils...not a huge infestation but still...once weevils get a foothold, its all over but the shouting.  I suspect that these boxes have been stored in a southern location as we dont have weevils up here in the north.  Usually they come up in flour and flour products that originate down south.  I found them in southern biscuit flour that I bought at one of the discount grocery stores.  I pop the product in the freezer to kill the weevils and their eggs and then sieve them out...gross, but you cant save money if you toss everything that doesnt meet your approval.  Anyway, cant sieve crackers but Im still tossing them into the freezer for good measure.  Dont want them to spread to any of my other pantry items.  This review is just a heads up to anyone buying these on Amazon.  Inspect them carefully, pop them in the freezer if in doubt, and enjoy.  The crackers get a 5-star rating; the purchase on Amazon gets a 3 star for warehouse storage. I bought Crunchies Freeze-Dried Organic Peas and some other Crunchies products in hopes they would be a satisfying, healthy snack for my children.  Both of my kids (ages 5 and 8) gave me the thumbs down on taste, though.  Same reaction to the other dried veggies and even the dried fruits. So, my desk at work is now full of Crunchies products, and they are a nice quick snack to keep me going between meals. I recommend them for this purpose, but I think most kids will probably say no to these products given the flavor of the snacks is OK, not great. Im a huge fan of the McCormick brand gravy mix and I assumed that this would be as good.  It isnt.  Its not bad enough for a 2 but im annoyed that i convinced myself to buy a case of this stuff instead of the McCormick. Tastes like darjeeling, although, like one of the previous reviewers said, its missing some of the body of a good darjeeling. I give it 3 stars for taste alone. But for the price I paid for it, I guess its still a solid dealYou get what you pay for and for the cost of this tea, I guess its good. :) Pros:- These are definitely tasty -- especially when taken from the freezer!- Wheat is not one of their ingredients, so theyre OK for gluten-sensitive but non-allergic people.Cons:- They contain (less than 2% of) soy (lecithin) which is a state recognized allergen.- They contain canola oil which is one of the least healthy oils on the market, devoid of nutrients and chemically processed.May be a con:- They contain palm oil which unless harvested conscientiously (and more expensively) significantly contributes to the rainforest destruction e.g. in Indonesia. I dont know how Nature Valleys suppliers harvest their palm oil -- hence the separate \"may be a con\" category. First of all, these things are delicious. However, opening them without making a mess is nearly impossible. Theyre super crumbly, so open the package with care. I wont buy them again. There are too many other good options that are way less messy. I purchased these with the intent to make vanilla extract. The bean arrived in a timely manner, and were in a vacuum sealed plastic bag. They didnt smell super vanilla-y when they arrived, but I can attest that they were soft and pliable-- maybe too pliable and greasy though. Almost immediate of being immersed in its vodka home, the beans left an oily residue on the top of the glass bottles. The grease has not necessarily gotten worse, but it has some type of oily smell that distracts from the richness of the vanilla. Any one else have this problem? I received my vanilla beans exactly a month ago today. As soon as I opened the package I LOVED them. They were very moist and I was very pleased at the quality of the beans. I immediately used 18 of the 50+ to make homemade vanilla extract. The beans did not come with storage instructions so I googled it and read that I needed to store them in an airtight container. Ive used them a few times over the past month for cooking but I still had over half the package left. Well, when I opened them this evening they were MOLDED. I am so very disappointed that I will be unable to use the rest of my beans. :( If youre able to use all 50 as soon as you get them, then I highly recommend these beans. If not, then I would look elsewhere, or order a smaller quantity. I dont really like the chunks of cherry and pistachios.  Id just rather have the plain dark chocolate.  I think the plain dark is the best dark chocolate sugar free bar available today. Im drinking oolong tea because Dr Oz said it would raise metabolism, the jury is still out.......really how would you know? I have lost weight but thats because I quit drinking coffee which I added too much cream to and started working out a lot more. It does not taste the all that great so I add 3 equals and drink it after it cools. Hi, i ordered this product from another website but i wanted to post a review on here since it has the same product.Okay first of all the packaging looks nice and neat not messy like others, just pure and simple...maybe too simple?.they dont give the ingredients info which is an automatic fail, on the back it says \"allergy warning CONTAINS: SOY\"  another failthey dont tell us what the gum does, does it whiten teeth? fight bad breath? or what!? you know...it has the word \"Vitality, which means active\" but thats all they say nothing more?....the taste is like any other gum We have used this product before and love it, so decided to send some as a gift to friends.  The cans were received dented.  Two of the cans were significantly dented.  The 3 cans were taped together, but no other packaging was in the box.  One side of the box was torn.  The shipping receipt was not included nor was the \"gift\" message that we had requested.  Our friends had no idea where these 3 beat up looking cans of Walnut Oil came from or who sent them until we called and asked if they had received them.  Shipping was also suppose to be in 2-3 days.  Was not received until day 6.  Will find another way to purchase this product, but not through Amazon. I found the oil a bit weak in taste. I had expected a stronger walnut flavor. I hope it is not chemically produced like most truffle oils. This product was okay tasting. My problem with it was the 10 oz container with less than 6 oz of sprinkles. Really?!? I tested this one on my twin 10-month old babies and they liked it immediately.  It was their first beef and their first spinach.  I had already given them chicken and they really like it so they are not vegetarians yet anyway.  Mostly I wanted this product for the spinach and the higher iron content.  Somehow they made this particular flavor brand tasty for babies.I like getting these by the case rather than buying them a jar at a time at the store since 2 babies eat so much.  Its good to keep several flavor brands around too I think, to give your baby a variety.  Im sure Ill get another case when this one is finished.Ingredients per the label: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Finely Ground Beef, Organic Spinach, Organic Garbanzo Bean Flour, Organic Tomato Paste, Organic Whole Durum Wheat Flour. CONTAINS: WHEAT.This has 110 calories, 31% protein, 100% vitamin A, 8% vitamin C, 4% calcium and 4% iron.  Ive been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult. Ive read other reviewers comment on the calorie content of this flavor and it must be high because when I was trying to wash the dish I served it in in was quite oily.  Also, it has a bit of a grainy texture and I think my 6 month old son finds the spinach a little difficult to digest. I was looking for another dinner to try and decided to spend the extra money on this one.  I thought.. my son loves chicken and mangos so why not this. He is not a fan. He will suffer through half a jar, but will not finish a whole one. I guess it was a little too exotic for his 9 month old taste buds.  We will keep trying.He loves, loves, loves the beef and spinach and will almost cry when the jar is gone. My dogs really did not care for these. were not real p-nutty. Received the shipment promptly but to my dismay, it did not contain the mini treats I had ordered, but \"small\", which were not that small.  I have very small dogs and I really wanted the minis. I contacted the seller (Petco) and after several days, they responded that I could return them but if I reordered minis, they would still send the small because Amazon had the item numbers wrong and they dont have minis. They said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit. This did not seem economically feasible, so I am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient. It definitely smells like dark chocolate but the taste is just average.... I cant say I taste the \"dark chocolate decadence\".... And its not that strong but usually I like stronger tasting coffee. Have had this gum from other sources and always liked it. This particular shipment seems to have much less peppermint flavor than before...could be it is older gum(there is no expiration date on it) or they are making it with less peppermint now. Otherwise I received this order very quickly. This is a great price, but every time Ive bought these through Amazon, the bottles frequently have dark... \"stuff\" on the threads of the bottle when you open it.  Ive never seen this when buying them from the local drugstore, so I worry that these are either old or maybe not authentic?Cant say for sure of course.  They do have the desired effect, so Im not complaining too much.  Its kind of gross sometimes though. I took it at 5am yesterday. It is now almost 3am the next day and I am laying in bed and skin feels tingly, cant sleep at all. I feel like I am at super sayan level 4, power of the red monkey. I could shoot ki blast out the window if I wanted too. Maybe some kame hame waves too. I did not expect this hot chocolate to be quite as sweet as I found it to be. It also has more calories than previous Ghiradelli similar hot chocolate.It has a rich taste and if I were not concerned with weight I would overlook the higher calories. The Chocolate Mocha flavor of this Hot Cocoa is really nice. Its different from the usual Hot Cocoa since it has a hint of Coffee. The quality is definitely there, I find it to be better then the Godiva brand. Mixes extremely easily, there is no residue and works with milk or even water mixed with half and half. I must say that it is a bit much of the same flavor, I would have rather 4 different flavors since the containers are big. Worth it though! A++ love the contents, but two of eight containers were badly dented.jan so anyways, i wished that i could find ginseng tea more easier, but for the price excluding the shipping i suppose its allright. comes in a weird form, not powder kinda like small bits of grass. Taste fine not sour or sweet This was a christmas present for my son in law who collects super hero stuff. He was surprised but really liked it. The pack of six bottles was delivered in a timely manner but when I opened up a bottle, the juice tasted sour.  I thought that it had spoiled in transit and considered returning the remaining bottles but then I noticed the very bottom line on the product label,\"Enriched with Organic Lemon Juice\".  It was too much trouble to return and, while I do not totally enjoy the tartness that the lemon juice adds, it is at least still pure and organic and healthy.I would not have ordered the product had I known that it was not JUST carrot juice but carrot juice with \"organic lemon juice\" added to it.  Perhaps this is why the price is so very right but I feel misled.It takes some getting used to if you are seeking the taste of carrot juice.  Before you order this item, I would suggest you buy a small bottle of carrot juice and squeeze some lemon juice into it to preview the effect of having lemon juice flavored carrot juice. Been waiting for this to be shipped for over 30 days.  Might be OK - hard to tell unless they send it. it is definatly not 4,000,000. half the heat of daves ghost sauce, maybe weaker. may be a good dipping sauce HAs a good taste it is a lil hott not 2 bad maybe just a lil less hotter than blaires ultra death sauces but has a better flavor Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly wont taste it.  My son liked them, so they wont go to waste.  I would not buy them again. This is the new \"Dublin\" dr pepper now bottled in Temple Texas.  This is produced after Dr. Pepper force Dublin out of production.  It is not the same as Dublin Dr. Pepper, that is why it is so cheap.  If you want the real thing, youll pay more for it. I received my 2 cases of Rice Works and the chips are awesome tasting and a great price BUT in every single bag (24) the chips were crunched/smashed into little pieces so i guess I have 24 bags of salad toppers or ..... but not chips. I tried these chips on a whim while shopping at COSTCO. They stopped carrying the chips and I had to look elsewhere for these delicious snacks. No local store carried them, so I turned to Amazon.com in hopes of finding them. As soon as I discovered them on the list of foods carried by Amazon, I ordered a box.When the box of chips arrived, I opened a bag of the  Riceworks Salasa Fresca chips, only to find not a single whole chip. The largest chip was no more than a quarter the size of a whole chip. It was impossible to use them to dip with. I hoped that was just an isolated bag of the product, but, most of the bags had similarly damaged chips. On average there were only a couple of whole chips to each bag.It was very disappointing to have a great slasa style chip reduced to rubble during shipping. Because of the condition of the chips upon arrival, I will not buy them from Amazon.com again.Great Chips when they are whole. A great disappointment when they are reduced to crumbled pieces. I have tried all of the RICEWORKS chips except for the sesame soy which i plan to try soon i have a un-opened bag still so far prefer the sweet chile chips. These chips are pretty healthy as far as chips go made from brown rice and pop when chewed on. I bought them @Top Foods here in WASHINGTON State Costco has the larger 16oz BAG in the sweet chile flavor only. Price was $2.99 at Top Foods for 5.5oz size $2.88 on Amazon for same size.Costco was $4.99 for the 16oz size... This cake always turns out consistently sweet and moist, but bland.  Compared to the new deluxe Duncan Hines version of German Chocolate cake, this is not impressive.  It will do when youre craving something different from regular chocolate cake, though. I bought this along with the regular dark roast at a considerable discounted price.  Well lets just say you get what you pay for.  The flavor really is not there and this as well is not much of a dark roast. I prefer rich, strong coffee and this product is a bit bland for my taste Chewy Lemonhead and Friends are my favorite candy. Period. I love them...so much....(cough)So when I found these I was really excited and bought a pack hoping theyd have that same tartness that makes Lemonhead and Friends so good!Nope. Tasted just like every other jelly-gummy type candy. I was very let down. It was okay for jelly/gummy, but dont expect much. Very crunchy and salty, just like described. I can also tell they use a lot of artificial  color. Not the best caviar. Might be really good for sushi! I couldnt really taste the bergamot in this tea.  It had more of a slight orange peel taste.  Since it is organic, I expected a cleaner, richer taste. Its OK, but not as good as the regular Twinings Earl Grey.  I have had other brands of organic that were superior to either of the Twinings, but at a much higher price. My two cats used to love this formula, but I guess they got tired of it, or maybe the formula was changed ... I only feed it occasionally now. The description of the item is \"small pieces, diced.\"  I would call them chopped. Theyre basically what youd find on a banana split or a sundae or perhaps decorating a chocolate cake or cupcake.  I like the toasted flavor and put them on oatmeal.  They do not come in a sealed package as shown in the photo.  Mine came in a folded over plastic bag inside a cardboard box. I was drawn to this product because its called a \"feast\", but I was somewhat put off by it being a \"Fancy Feast\". My cat certainly deserves a feast! I mean, he runs himself ragged from morning till night going after mice and by the end of the day hes bushed. And frustrated too, since I had him declawed and all. But he dont need anything fancy, thats for sure. I just want him to enjoy a cat feast and leave it at that. Hes not one of them cats that prances around with his bushy tail waving around like some lady feline. I know my Tubby Toughie would be in cat heaven if they changed the name to \"Fighter Feast\" or \"Beastly Feast\". So, Im giving this product 3 stars: five stars because its a pretty great feast, minus three stars because the name offends Tubby Toughie, and plus one star because I like to lick the can. I purchased the Wood Smoked flavor.  The reviewers who said that these are too salty were right.  They tastes like sticks of salts.  If you nibble on them very slowly, then they tastes ok as the salts disolve slowly.  If you take a big bite, then it would be like biting into a chunk of salt.  I love the texture and the stringiness of this beef jerky but I would not buy it again because of the high sodium content. This beef jerky is extremely salty. I tried the wood smoked flavor, and I figured people were just being a bit picky. However, it really is overpowering and although it has a decent smoky flavor the salt is just way too much. The container says 570mg sodium or 24% of daily value for one serving. I would recommend trying a different product. Was hoping that the pieces would be a bit flatter in structure, but they shy away from sausage stick territory fine enough.  Flavor wasnt bad, but nothing to write home about.  Im just glad they werent that greasy. I honestly cannot say that I saw any difference whatsoever in this variety compared to Friskies regular sliced beef version.  Actually, my cat preferred the regular Friskies over this one.  Hes not really all that jazzed over these Fancy Feast varieties anyway, so if youre going to buy this one or the chicken, save your money and buy the regular Friskies versions.  They seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money.  Ive never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so I guess Ill get the special ones instead. Once or twice a year for a little variety and thats about enough for my cat of this particular variety.  He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then hes had enough. Hes not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Dont know why my cat doesnt like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it. This food variety is ground, thus my cat doesnt care that much for this variety. But, he liked the taste of it a lot so I have been buying it off and on throughout the years.  My previous cat really liked it so Ive purchased quite a few of these.  Its got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares? If your cat likes ground, give this one a try for sure. I absolutely loved Newmans Own pretzels with the pepper baked right into the pretzel for just a little bite. These are not as tasty and yes, they are messy and overly seasoned.  Not really a fan of this line of flavored broken pretzel pieces, although this was a little better than some of their other flavors.Someone out there needs to try making the baked-in black pepper version again, please. Not sure why Newmans Own stopped. The package arrived 3 days earlier then it said it would and they were very fresh. They were also cheaper then the candy. Some of the candy had melted together but it was only maybe 3 pieces per bag. Overall really good. I have to add that Ive not baked with this yet. But when I received this I was aghast at the ingredients. Perhaps I didnt read it well because the ingredient list is right there... I guess I simply expected alcohol & vanilla beans, maybe sugar, in an \"ol timey\" product.Ill update this once I use it. These are sort of like brownies.  A little soft, a little dry.  My 7 year old really likes them.  Theyre good if you are on a restricted diet, but otherwise nothing too special. It is close to impossible to find a cookie that is both soy free, wheat free, and the only sugar that is used is from natural juices: apple, etc. That is the only reason I gave the cookie such a high ranking...As for taste, the chocolate flavor is pronounced, I enjoy the \"crunch\", however, the texture of the cookie has a lot to be desired. The cookie needs to either be crunchier or more moist. As is it wants to stick to the roof of your mouth, and is just odd. Making it unappealing. If I had tasted the item prior to ordering, I wouldnt have bought a whole box full. Our family has members who keep kosher, who are vegetarians, who are unable to eat gluten, etc.  This cookie covers all the bases, but tends to be soft and not entirely tasty.  However, they can be used to make a gluten free pie crust, which is a great feature.  I have the feeling that if they were baked a little longer they would be better.Really, though, how good can a gluten free cookie be? I love Nanas GF lemon cookies, so I figured Id try these berry vanilla bars too.  Theyre a nice, soft texture but I am not crazy about the taste.  I feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries, just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie.  I think I will try the chocolate bars next time around. In the past I have purchased these cookie bars through Amazon and have had good business. However, Amazon has not kept up with the ingredients changing in these cookie bars. It is very important to me what ingredients are in the foods I purchase. I am not happy with Amazons business this time. Ingredients change often! Amazon needs to keep up to date with the ingredients if they are going to have them listed on their website. I love Community Coffee but the batch I received of the Special Decaf was old the bags had lost their vacuum packed state. This tea is so strong you might as well not waste time brewing and just chew the leaves right out of the container. Its strong not in a normal strong tea way. Instead its bitter. If you use a Keurig model that has cup size settings a recommendation is to go with the largest setting for the largest cup you can fit under the Keurig and work backward from there until you get to the taste you prefer. Also note that while its in smaller print, there is a warning not to use a glass to make the iced tea which is a warning worth paying attention to. Although these are a quality dog treat please be aware that these do contain chicken. I did not see this ingredient listed on the product page. This is just to advise those pet parents if your kiddo has a poultry or chicken allergy like mine do that every variety to date contains both chicken and natural chicken flavor.The ingredients are as followed for the Low Calorie varietyIngredients:Organic brown rice powder, rice powder, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch, oat fiber, chicken, natural chicken flavor, dehydrated carrots, organic flaxseed, cranberries, apples, cinnamon, parsley, chia seed, carrageenan (natural seaweed extract), l-carnitine, peppermint, l-ascrobyl-2-polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), green tea extract (decaf). THESE TREATS ARE MORE FOR A LARGER DOG AS THEY ARE VERY HARD AND THICK.  THE GIRLS (my maltese) LIKE THEM EXCEPT WAY TOO BIG AND HARD TO CHEW FOR THEM.. These are a good alternative to candy, but still a lot of sugar in a better form.Sharkies energy sports chews are not quite so sweet BUT are Healthier becasue the man ingredient is brown rice syrup which is a complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index. Being very hypogylcemic brown rice syrup and agave nectar are the only two natural sweetners that dont cause a \"sugar crash\". So for this reason the stingers only get 3 stars and sharkies get 5! If you want sweeter in sharkies get the kids version, but they are like stingers- no brown rice syrup. Oh, the brown rice version fill me up faster because they are a complex carbohydrate and dont cause blood sugar fluctuations. I am a huge fan of Stinger products. However, these little gummy gels do nothing as compared to the Stinger Honey Packs. If you are a road or mountain biker and need a good burst of quick energy to keep from bonking on that last hill, these will not help. In fact, the only benefit that I (or any of my riding buddies) have found is that they make your mouth water. Conceivably, this could help with water consumption when riding through the desert (Moab, Fruita). It is my guess that these are not intended for exercising. Maybe, people just use them at work to keep from eating Starburst or something less healthy?! This sparkling juice drink has a decent and refreshing flavor, though somewhat reminiscent of the canned orange juice (cant remember the brand) I had once in awhile as a kid.Its a nice idea to have a soda that has no added sugar, though the juice combination isnt as impressive as the name might sound. This beverage contains a mix of the following juices (reconstituted with sparkling water): apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. The beverage also includes gum acacia and soy.Despite the fact that there are no added sugars, the calorie and carb counts are quite high - in fact higher than an average soda. An 8.3 ounce can contains 140 calories and 36g carbs. There are no surprises here. The label promises a perfect blend between juice and carbonation, and that is exactly what Switch delivers: a drink that tastes like carbonated orange juice. Those looking for a healthier alternative to soda will like that Switch contains 100% juice with no added sugar or corn syrup. Those looking for a tasty new carbonated beverage probably wont be impressed.At the time of this writing, Amazon isnt yet stocking Switch so I cant offer an opinion on whether or not I think the price is fair. I wouldnt expect to pay much more than orange juice for this drink, though, since theres nothing really original going on inside the can. I thought this would have a similar taste to another brand of carbonated juice on the market, called Izze, that has fewer calories, tastes better and costs less. However, Switch has a weird artificial aftertaste. It tastes like a blend between orange juice and orange soda, but not in a good way. Also, with 140 calories per serving (8.3 ounces) and 34 grams of sugar, you might as well drink soda- because this beverage it not any healthier and certainly not cheaper. If you like the sort of carbonated fruit punch that you get at, e.g., office holiday parties (where alcohol is verboten), youll probably like The Switch: It does have a nice, \"fruity\" taste (kind of a \"sharp\" orange -- perhaps the tangerines influence, although probably more the apple juice), with a bit of a bite due to the carbonation.  If this were one of my options at, e.g., the Medusa-esque soda dispensers found at 7-11, I would definitely indulge occasionally and buy some.But an indulgence it is... and thats why Im not planning on purchasing more from Amazon.  In particular:-- Youre paying nearly a buck a can for a little more than a cup of soda.  Please.  I dont mind paying more for higher-quality goods, but at least make it a decent value for the money... make it 12oz.-- Calorically its not a great value, having around half-again as many calories per once as Coca Cola does.  If youre some teen who can eat whatever you want, this doesnt matter... but for those of us who arent blessed with such metabolisms... well... the calories are better \"spent\" elsewhere.  The \"no sugar added!\" bit is somewhere between annoying and downright misleading: The \"all natural\" sugar thats coming from the fruit juices is no better nor worse for you than, e.g., regular old cane sugar like better traditional soft drinks have.So, in brief, yes, it is quite tasty, but its really not a good deal for your pocketbook nor your health unless consumed only on special occasions.P.S. -- My wife tried some as well, and didnt like it as much; she tasted some of the unpleasant \"metallic\" tastes that others here have mentioned. I split this can with my spouse.  I would have given it 2 stars, he gave it 3.  Nice idea, 100% carbonated juice, but the taste is pretty mild.  Not really what I would call refreshing.  Good idea, though, I would try it in other flavors. No caffeine, no high fructose corn syrup, 100% juice, nothing artificial. Whats not to like?I hate to write anything negative because I dont want to discourage development of any products that avoid HFCS. But, to be honest, The Switch Orange Tangerine doesnt smell very good. If youre familiar with Airborne Cold Remedy, well, it smells like that. I think I was expecting a fragrance like Tang instant beverage. I certainly didnt expect it to smell like it does. Its not all that bad, its just not real good.I also think this product would actually taste better if it werent carbonated.The calories are about the same as a typical soda. But theyre fruit juice calories instead of HFCS, so thats a big plus in my book. With all-natural ingredients and mostly real fruit juice, Im not expecting this drink to taste like soda, punch, or anything like that, but I when I tasted it, I felt myself wanting more. I could really taste the orange-flavor coming though, but they somehow missed me on the tangerine side. Tangerines are very sweet, so I was expecting that to be the predominant flavor, but instead what I tasted was mostly orange, which left a somewhat sour/bitter aftertaste in my mouth. This drink wasnt bad, but given a choice, Id rather drink orange juice or tangerine juice with seltzer. I dont see how this drink improves beyond that. Switchs other available flavors tasted much better, so in some ways this was a disappointment. At 22.99 for a pack of 24 cans of Switch orange Tangerine, youre paying about 96 cents per can. Is it worth it? Not really. First of all, you drink juice for health reasons. Vitamins, frutose over corn syrup and the like. Carbonating beverages generally arent considered good for you, so its odd that the two would be mixed.Besides the carbonation, and the aluminum can (which has been proved can lead to Alzheimers) theres a lot of deceptive marketing going on. The can claims that Switch is 100% juice, but its not actually 100% Orange and Tangerine juice. In fact, the drink is mostly apple and grape juice. You can taste this instantly, along with the metallic tang of being in a can. This is done because both of those juices are quite cheap in comparison to orange and tangerine. So really, youre getting more a a carbonated fruit punch then an orange tangerine drink.Youre also gettinbg \"Natural flavours and colours\" which kind of kills the whole \"100% juice\" claim.With a taste that is both metallic and not really resembling the flavours it claims, I cant really recommend this product, You can generally buy boxed 100% juice for less, which contains more flavour, no aluminum and no carbonation. I didnt really like the taste of this product much.  It has an artificial taste to me, even though it is juice and water.  It is a carbonated drink and it somewhat reminded me of the taste of baby aspirin, although not quite that bad.  I did drink the whole can.  The 8.3 oz can is narrow, compared to the 12 oz soda can you are used to seeing.The can says it is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all natural with no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and gluten free.  The nutrition box indicates (for the entire 8.3 oz can) 15mg sodium, 36g carbs, 34 g sugar, Vitamin C 100 %, Vitamin A 20%.The ingredients are as follows and are listed in the following order: 100% juice (filtering sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates), gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). Contains soy. (First ingredient listed is supposed to be the one there is the most of.)You may wonder why I spent so much time on the ingredients.  Well, if you dont read labels, you really should start.  Some products may taste really good but may be full of nasty things you really do not want your children to eat (or yourself).  The term, gluten free, for example is VERY important to those who have gluten intolerance.Kudos to the manufacturer for making a healthier product and I would have liked to have given this flavor a better review, but the taste was not there for me.  The black cherry flavor has a lot better taste.Still, if you are looking for a seemingly healthier beverage to pack in your childs lunch, this could be worth a try.  Think of it as a flavored carbonated water.  I gave it 3 stars because it is not unhealthy and it is not bad - just not something I like the taste of.I would sooner put this product in a childs lunch than a soda.  My daddy used to put soda on the cars battery terminals to dissolve the acid :-( This was a weird drink - I had high expectations, but the flavor was just odd - it really did taste like fizzy Tang drink mix.  However, my kids really liked it, and I think it is a great alternative to junky soda, so I will most likely buy more - but not for ME to drink.  ;) It may be all natural but it didnt have a natural taste to me.  The can size is small and the calories were more than I thought there should be.  I like the mild carbonation ok but I wouldnt switch from orange juice. I had to try this Orange Tangerine flavor because I had tried the watermelon/strawberry and didnt like it very much, but wanted to give this company another shot. I do prefer this Orange tangerine; it has a nice citrus flavor with that carbonated fizzy on the tongue sensation. I give it a 3, better then the watermelon/strawberry and on ice I drank the whole can. I didnt read the label before I tried the drink, so I was a little surprised by the carbonation.  It had a tangy flavor which was possibly enhanced somewhat by the carbonation.  However, Ive been a long-time drinker of the Tropicana Orange-Tangerine juice and Switch is simply not as good, IMHO.  If I wasnt already a Tropicana drinker, I might be interested in the Switch version of Orange-Tangerine, but Im not going to \"switch\".  Sorry for the pun. On the plus side, they get the flavor and carbonation right here.  One fears a Tang taste, but its more subtle than that and the bubbles are likewise discrete enough that its no Fizzy-Lifting Drink.On the downside though, one would prefer a sharper after taste to the sort of syrupy way it stays on the tongue. Its a refreshing drink when served cold. A bit sweet when warm. A little tart, but tolerably so.The flavor is less orange than tangerine, yet I can distinguish several different \"layers\" of citrus in it, including the orange. Its an interesting sensation.I am a little bugged by the fact that an 8.3oz can (2/3rd-size) manages to pack more junk calories in than a full-sized can of cola. Its also supposed to be 100% juice, but reconstituted grape juice is practically pure sugar and there are \"natural flavors\" noted in the ingredients list as well as a soy warning which to me implies some sort of MSG, probably added with the citric acid.So, maybe its not an especially healthy beverage. Its still tasty and provides a diversion from more typical sodas. Bottled like an energy drink, Switch, doesnt contain the things youd find in other carbonated beverages. Theres no sugar, no caffeine, no corn syrup, no preservatives or artificial colors.Instead, what you get is a refreshing, all-natural, lightly carbonated tangerine-orange drink loaded with Vitamin C. Think of it as orange soda without all the things you dont want. Switch has just the right amount of carbonation to make the beverage refreshing without being filling.Its a zippy beverage made with real tangerine, apple, and grape juices, and would make a refreshing beverage, lunch, dinner, or snack-time drink.There was a slight aftertaste that Im chalking up to either the can or the citrus, but it didnt get in the way of enjoying the drink.Make the \"switch\" to Switch. The biggest argument I have with Switch is that at a hair under $1 for each 8.3 oz can, its awfully expensive.  I probably could overlook that if Switch was really, really delicious, but frankly its not.  The orange-tangerine blend lacks the zip and character of those citrus fruits, particularly tangerine and its delicate sweetness.Instead, theres a heavy taste of the apple-grape combination of juices that forms the fruit base.  Theres no added sugar, no high fructose corn syrup or any other sweeteners save the apple and grape concentrates, and thats fine, Id prefer my juice to not have added sweeteners.  In my opinion, juice doesnt need to be sweetened.  I suspect that the fruit concentrate combo is cheaper than making the drink out of pure citrus juice, so I wonder why its as expensive as it is.What makes me scratch my head is the notation \"Contains soy.\"  What?  Why?  Why on earth put soy in a fruit juice cooler?  Honestly, Id buy some seltzer or carbonated water of some sort and mix it with my own fruit juice before Id buy Switch.  But if youd rather have it pre-made, then by all means give it a try.  Its decent enough, just not my glass of juice. Switch does not taste like carbonated juice.  It tastes like overly sweet orange soda, which may or may not be a positive for you.  The 8.3 ounce can contains 34 grams of sugar.  I did not like the taste, my husband thought it was okay.The reason Im giving it 3 stars instead of 2 is because it does not have any preservatives, added sugars, or high fructose corn syrup.  It does however contain soy, so if you are allergic or concerned about GMO soy, then you may want to avoid this drink.If you are looking for a natural, sweet, carbonated beverage, I would recommend OOBA Hibiscus drink over this. If youre looking for a healthy alternative to your favorite orange soda, this might be a good choice for you.This is one of the better tasting Switch flavors, although it still tastes a bit like a flat orange Faygo or Slice drink.  Its good, but theres a bit of an aftertaste to watch out for.  It doesnt give you that weird filled up feeling that carbonated beverages seem to have, but if youre looking for some refreshment on a hot summer day (90+ degrees where I live as I write this), Id stick to tried-and-true Kool-Aid instead.Decent, and a good orange soda alternative, but not life changing. This is a decent flavored carbonated juice.  Its 100% juice which is good for the more health conscious people.  It tastes pretty good, sweet and a little tangy.  But the flavor does fall short.  Like some reviewers have said, the drink tastes more like a punch than pure orange or tangerine juice.  Do yourself a favor, if you want orange flavored soda, then go for an orange flavored soda.  If you want tangerine, then buy tangerine.  The infusion of both flavors really causes both flavors to fall short slightly short. Like the SWITCH beverage I previously reviewed, this is a moderately tasty drink.  The balance of the carbonation and the fruit juice is decent enough, giving more of a tickle to the tongue than the rush of bubbles that soda usually gives.  Its definitely a lot more like juice than soda, which goes against its purpose of being a replacement for soda.  Overall, its pretty drinkable, but I would never seek this beverage out.  There are better juices, and there are better sodas.One major plus, though, was that it wasnt as thick and syrupy as the Watermelon/Strawberry SWITCH.6/10 I really didnt think there was anything special about this product. It doesnt have a bad taste, but it is different than a regular orange flavored soda. It is definitely not as sweet (which isnt a bad thing for me as I find the orange sodas way too sweet) and left a tiny bit of an odd aftertaste. It is a healthier alternative to regular sodas as there is no high fructose corn syrup, but it was still just as caloric. It is juice rather than artificial syrups, but the first juices listed in the ingredients are the overly sweet apple and grape constitutes, not orange and tangerine, to make the drink taste sweeter I suppose. Honestly, considering the price of this product and the lukewarm impression it left on me, I would rather just pour my own juice blend and add soda water or sparkling water to it myself. Most juices seem to be vitamin C fortified themselves, so unless you are just looking to replace the artificial sodas with something less damaging, I cant see a big benefit to this product. I thought I would like this more than I do. Maybe its my palate, but my first taste impression was pineapple, not orange or tangerine. The small portion size may be acceptable for an energy drink, but is not what I would call thirst-quenching. Not a good choice for anyone trying to control calories or carbs. On the plus side, it is sweet, but not too sweet and the level of carbonation is well-balanced. I dont like how so many bottled and canned drinks these days (even the low-calorie ones) are so sweet.  This was nicely not-too-sweet, but had a canned, not fresh juice flavor.  It is personal taste, but I didnt care for the processed flavor. Im not a big fan of carbonated juices, but am a huge lover of orange/tangerine.  In that respect, this was a disappointment for me, not being as tangeriny enough for me.  The first sip left me with an extremely unpleasant aftertaste, but had gotten easier to tolerate with additional sips.  But, after waiting a while for another sip, that initial unpleasantness returned.  If Im going to drink juice, Ill stick to what I prefer, uncarbonated. Looks can be deceiving, especially with this product:  The cute, tiny can looks great, but dont fall for it!  This little guy packs an amazing 140 calories per 8.3 oz can.  My favorite 24 oz Arizona Iced Tea(black/white tea with sugar) has almost just as many calories(150) and almost 3 times the size of Switch.  Also, do not be tempted with \"100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin E\" pitch either.  Most of us consume 100% of daily Vitamin C without even trying through foods and anything extra get eliminated.The taste however does feel a bit more natural than other artificial orange sodas though, so thats the only plus.  Also, if you do not worry about gaining weight, I guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can.Overall, a good-tasting product, but there are many other low-caloric alternatives out there.  A can of Diet Coke and a multivitamin anyone? When I tried a can of Switch Orange Tangerine I was expecting to taste something similar to Orange Crush or Sunkist soda.  Switch is actually quite different.Switch claims that it doesnt add any extra sugar or common additives found in most mainstream sodas.  And when you taste it, I believe them.  Since it doesnt have the added refined sugar of an Orange Crush-type soda, Switch comes across with a subtly harsher, more acidic taste. This can of Switch tastes like...well...carbonated orange juice.  To me, this is a good thing.  I enjoyed the flavor and found it tasty and pleasantly unique.Given all that, I would absolutely buy this product all of the time if it wasnt for the unfortunate price.  These cans are only 8.3 ounces and cost close to $1 per can.  Thats a heck of a lot more than the $0.25-$0.33 you pay for a 12 ounce can of mainstream soda (when purchased as a typical 12 or 24 pack).I love the taste of this stuff, I love that it doesnt have all kinds of extra refined sugar, and I hate the price.  I want to buy it, but I just cant afford it and have to drop it to 3-stars on that merit alone.  Too bad. The Switch Orange Tangerine soda is an attempt to made a fruit soda with real fruit juice, real fruit flavor, and no added sugar.  They have mostly succeeded.  In the glass, the Switch looks like juice.  It is lightly but distinctly carbonated and easy to drink.  The orange and tangerine flavors are true - none of the \"burn\" of fake orange flavor.  The hit of tangerine is really nice and I greatly enjoyed the flavor.  My problem with the Switch was that it was too sweet for my taste.  I was surprised at the how sweet it was given the advertised \"no added sugar\".  The ingredient list mentions grape and apple juice concentrates.  Thats how they get the sugars in without adding sugar.  Fruit juice concentrates are loaded with natural fruit sugars.  The nutritional label tells the story:  the 8.3 oz can has 34 grams of sugar!  Thats more than Cocoa Cola (27 grams per 8 oz).  Bottom line - this is just too sweet for me.  Its too bad because the flavors are awesome.  If you have a sweet tooth, maybe this is for you. This drink is ok. A little pricier with several more calories and carbs than I would like, but it is a good alternative to soda. I am glad theres no artificial sweetener in it. Its sweet enough without it. I like the Crayons drinks better, but cannot find them anymore. I also like the flavor of the R.W. Knudsen Spritzers a little more. Im always looking for a carbonated alternative to sodas so I thought Id give this a try. Generally I enjoy drinking naturally flavored sparkling water like La Croix or Crystal Geyser. I also very much enjoy Izzys sparkling water/juice blends. Unlike Izzy, which combines juice and water, this is a 100% juice beverage that is carbonated. I have to say, it is definitely full of flavor, but its just too sweet tasting. I like a bit of orange juice now and then, but for this type of carbonated drink, Im just not into all that sweetness. I tried diluting it with some sparkling water, but the flavor just wasnt quite what I wanted. I like that Izzy is just a bit on the tart side with its flavors. This is a nice idea and its pretty ok. I just prefer other beverages over this one. I just tried the Orange tangerine version of The Switched carbonated drink and overall I like it.  It tastes very similar to mandarin orange Slice but it uses natural juices and no HFCS.  If you are very concerned about artificial flavors and HCFS, but still want a carbonated drink, then Switched may be a good alternative.  I read the ingrediants list and it mainly included reconstituted juces and then aboiut another line of preservatives and additives, I would assume similar to those in commercial fruit juices.Personally, I am more concerned about overall sugar and calories in my soft drinks so this little 8 oz can has 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar.  If memory serves me that is in line with the calories of most softdrinks and more sugar then most soft drinks.Ultimately, i think this is a good tasing product, but the touted benefits doesnt outweigh the increased price and availability conpared to regualar soda.  I guess the key is still moderation. I wasnt sure what to expect from a carbonated fruit drink, but decided to give it a try.  While it was drinkable, I actually prefer the natural taste of fruit juice.  This actually tasted like an artificial soda, much like a very well known orange soda.  The carbonation was excessively strong, with too much bite and burn for my liking.As some other reviewers pointed out, the amount of sugar and calories in this drink was astounding.  It is almost too sweet, and combined with the carbonation was just too much for me to enjoy it very much. This one tasted pretty good.  Very tangy, but in a real fruit kind of way.  I think they got this one right.  I still cant ever see myself buying a bunch of this.  Maybe if amazon sent me more than a single can to try, I would have build a habbit of drinking them (cough..hint..cough).I dont really understand any drink this size.  If I were thirsty at all, I would want way more, at least 12 oz.  The only other drinks this size are those crazy energy drinks, and those are obviously more of a means to an end kind of drink.  I guess it is supposed to be more of a gourmet soda/juice.  I guess there is a market for that, Im just not part of it.Nice little carbonated juice, but still not really worth the effort/money for me. Switch has \"100% of what you want\" and \"0% of what you dont,\"  according to the can.  Also, according to the can it is \"100% juice.\"  According to the Amazon product page it contains soy.  Quoting the printed page:  \"Ingredients: 100% Juice (Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange and Acerola Juice Concentrates), Gum Acacia, Natural Flavors and Colors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). Contains Soy.\"There is an unusual taste.  It is difficult to decide whether it is the taste of the can or the taste of the soy.The price is surprising. The calories are shocking. One can has 140 calories.Who knows?  We may develop a taste for Switch. At first, I really wanted to like this drink. \"The Switch\" tasted like tangerines and had a good aroma. The drink is carbonated, but not really strongly so. It is pleasant. However, after a few seconds, an after taste developed that was a little bitter. My wife thought this after taste was even a little \"off\", but she has a more sensitive palate than I do. In any case, the net effect was that I would just as soon have Orangina, and I wont be going out to buy more of \"The Switch\" Orange Tangerine. On the other hand, if this is what was being served at a party or gathering with few or no other choices, I wouldnt avoid it either. I love juice and I love carbonated beverages, but it is difficult to see this product having a long retail life.Essentially, this is a good drink that doesnt really do anything well.It doesnt taste good enough to be a juice replacement--and is there really a need for a juice replacement?  It might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers.Its not exactly a post-workout recovery drink.  Juice would be better.  Minute Maid juice, for instance, has less sugar and carbohydrates, even though Switch doesnt add any sugar.  And there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients, including Calcium and other vitamins and supplements, including potassium.  So, its less healthy than most juices.Switch isnt exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks.As a regular alternative to sugared soda, it tastes good, but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit-based sodas.  And, $22 a case, its more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans.So, in the end, Switch is worth a try but likely not something you will habitually buy. Ive tried the Black Cherry version of this drink, and I prefer that to this. Both are light and refreshing and WAY better than fruit-flavored waters. YUK! You can tell by the taste these are definitely fruit juices but without the sticky, thick, sweetness of a non-carbonated drink. This orange tangerine flavor though - theres this weird taste to it one that hits you immediately. Not quite bitter, not quite metallic, but definitely not yummy - unless you like bitter fruit - not sour - bitter. Maybe its too much carbonation for my taste. If youve tried the other flavors and are looking to try something new - think twice about this one. It is tingly and refreshing, but I wont order it again. I didnt mind the taste of this very much - it tasted like Minute Maid OJ mixed with soda.  My husband couldnt stand it at all.  My only issue with this was that it was a heavy-syrup sort of flavor that was a little overwhelming.  If there was a better balance of flavor to liquid to make it a little lighter tasting, I think this would be much more refreshing and enjoyable.  Might be fine for kids though - since they like that sugary orange stuff. <span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 2:47 Mins</span>Short video review with first open, pour and taste of The Switch Orange Tangerine. My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the soda \"Orange Crush,\" although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike \"Orange Crush,\" this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didnt get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didnt get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 140 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldnt say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.If they created a 12 ounce can and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase it.Shawn KovacichAuthor of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series. The Switch bills itself as \"great tasting healthy alternative to soda\" so I decided to see for myself. The first thing I wanted to do was compare its nutritional facts against my favorite orange soda and this is how they matched up:The Switch Orange Tangerine (Per Serving)16.97 Calories1.8 mg Sodium4.3 g Carb4.1 g Sugar20% RDA Vitamin A100% RDA Vitamin CNational Brand Orange Soda (Per Serving)15.8 Calories3.7 mg Sodium4.3 g Carb4.3 g SugarBesides slightly less sodium, the addition of vitamins and no added sugars <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O\">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> didnt really stand out as a winner based on nutritional facts alone. So when it came to drinking it, I had expected to prefer the more natural taste that The Switch might offer.  Unfortunately the main two juices used in this drink are Apple and Grape and that left me not tasting the \"Orange Tangerine\" as much as I had wanted.Overall when comparing the two beverages not only did it not impress me with taste or nutrition, but add on the obvious price difference ($.03 per ounce vs. $.11 per ounce) and The Switch wont be causing me to switch. Im happy to stick with my good old orange soda. I tried this product after Switchs Watermelon-Strawberry drink, and while I thought that drink was decent, I was not a big fan of the Orange-Tangerine flavor.  The taste was an obvious blend of a number of different flavors in addition to orange and tangerine, and for me that made it taste more Orange-ish than Orange.  As others have noted, the amount of calories and sugar are not that different from a cola, so its not really clear that its THAT much healthier than other sodas.Personally though, Id rather just grab a glass of orange juice or eat an orange instead.  I guess it depends on what you are deciding to \"switch\" from: for people looking for an alternative to cola, I guess this might be an attractive product.  But as someone who prefers water or tea and rarely drinks sodas, this product isnt close to making me want to \"switch\". If you like a little fizz with your juice this is a good product.  Tasty and refreshing.  However, like all juice it is not low in calories, so dont buy it expecting it to be more like a low cal fruit flavored sport drink. For a beverage that is basically 100% fruit juice that has been carbonated, with no sweetners or preservatives added, Switch Orange Tangerine pretty much tasted to me like a can of Orange Crush or Sunkist soda.That isnt a bad thing, per se...but it was not something I would pay a premium for if I were in the mood for orange soda.  Presumably, it is a little bit healthier than a straight soda, but it is nothing special to taste, and thus I will not go through the effort to seek it out.(On the other hand, my 16 year old daughter claimed to like it MORE than orange soda, and in fact said that she felt she could taste the grape juice in it.  As with many juices, even though it is orange \"flavored\"...grape juice is a major ingredient.  So she would give it four stars.) The Switch Orange/Tangerine gets kudos from me for not including added sugars and nasty ingredients found in some traditional sodas, but as for flavor, it leaves something to be desired.  The initial yummy tangerine flavor of the drink is great, but after a few swallows, a strange after-taste invaded my mouth.  I found it difficult to drink the whole can. My 7 year old daughter thought it was good tasted like pop but only drank 1/2 of the can. I thought it tasted like watered down orange soda with very little fizz with funny after taste. It is suppose to be  100% juice with vitamin C that has been carbonated. Ok here is my thought either buy 100% orange juice that taste like it came right of the tree or buy a orange pop. For me this product wont be flying off the shelves. I really liked the taste of both this and one other flavor that we were able to order.  So I went on line to see what kind of pricing there was on it.  At only 8.3 oz. for about a dollar, thats roughly the equivalent of $1.50 for a single can if it was a full 12 oz. soft drink.  Our budget isnt going to justify ongoing purchases of this product.  If we had more discretionary money, we might do it, but itd be more of a treat than a regularly used product (partly because of the small size).  So the taste was at least 4-stars, but the price brought it down considerably - even recognizing the fact that the ingredients are far better than what is in most other soft drinks. This orange soda is clearly more healthful, and it tastes tangier, although somewhat less sweet, than other orange sodas.  The one big drawback for me was that this drink lacks caffeine. I want to start this review by stating that this is not the perfect balance between juice and carbonated drink Ive ever had.  That said this is certainly a good alternative for those who love carbonated drinks but dont like some of the ingredients.  Switch has attempted to address this concern and I feel its a step in the right direct.  This is an Orange Tangerine flavored juice that is carbonated but without added sugar, preservatives, corn syrup, or caffeine.  In other words this is about as natural as you can get without, you know, drinking real orange juice.The can is also thinner then a soda can so youre not getting as much liquid as you would a Pepsi or Coke.  This means there is less fat in each can, and the makers claim the product is glutton free.  It does have a bit of a weird aftertaste, but after a few sips it stops bothering you.  While not a perfect drink its one I enjoyed and will likely pick up again in the future. I chuckled a little when I read that this soda had no added sugar when I checked the label in the can since it already has 34gms of sugar anything more added and youll have sugar junkies of whoever tries the drink.  The soda is tasty and quite fizzy, I think it has more carbonation than Fanta which goes flat easier.  The can is the typical size of an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink merely another fruit flavored soda.  It is flavored naturally, but that is the only difference from regular soda type drinks. According to the side of the can, its 100% juice with a balance on the carbonation. It tastes great if not for the chalky aftertaste. The low carbonation made it feel less of a soda and more of a juice. I probably wouldnt buy it in the store because of the weird taste. This carbonated product has a nice natural juice taste to it that makes you feel like youre drinking something that might be a little healthier than all the other carbonated stuff out there on the shelves but I couldnt help but notice the amount of sugar this thing has listed on the nutrition facts:34g per 8.3 oz can of the stuff. 36g total carbs.Like I said, its good but dont get fooled into thinking its any healthier for you. Theres no artificial stuff in here according to the can at least. This product claims to be a healthy carbonated product. This particular flavor is very heavy on the orange taste (which is to be expected). As a matter of fact, I found it very close to normal orange soda.Here are the claims of the product from the label:100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All Natural, Carbonated, Great Taste and Refreshment.No Sugar Added, No Corn Syrup, No Preservatives, No Artificial Colors, Gluten FreeNutritional Information:Serving Size 8.3 Fl. Oz. (245 ml)Servings: 1Calories: 140Fat: 0gSodium: 15 mgTotal Carb: 36g (Sugar 34g)Protein: 0gVitamin C: 100% RDAVitamin A: 20%Ingredients:  100% Juice (filtered spring water sufficient to reconstitute concentrates, apple grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates), gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Contains Soy.Compared to soda, it is healthier in that it doesnt contain added sugars or corn syrup.  But it still has a bunch of calories.  Eating fruits whole is better than juice, but if you want a quick soda-like pick me up (and you love orange soda), I would recommend this product over regular soda.I gave this product 3 stars because I dont think it really is that healthy, but is a decent alternative to regular soda. Also, the taste was ok, nothing remarkable. The SWITCH ORANGE TANGERINE SODA doesnt taste too bad and it is carbonated, but the taste reminded me of orange juice that went sour. You know, when the O.J. has gone way past the expiration date and you gulp some and it has that bitter acidic taste.Anyway, the soda is made from a combination of apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice, and doesnt add sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or artificial colors. Its also gluten free so thats good news for those who are trying to watch what they eat and drink.The 8.3-ounce can is smaller than the standard 12-ounce can of soda and maybe it just takes a couple of tries to get used to the flavor.Like I said, not bad but Ill stick with regular/diet soda. But for a healthier alternative for soda lovers, I suggest trying one of the \"SWITCH SODAS\" OR any naturally flavored sparkling water. Sometimes if too many flavors are mixed together, the result tastes like none of them.  This doesnt taste like orange or tangerine.  It tastes, to me at least, very sweet and sort of orangy but not tart at all, and I like my citrus type sodas to be tart and sort of sour.Still, great for those who are trying to get away from the high fructose corn syrup diet. I was really looking forward to sampling this product. Its not bad, but a little too sweet-tasting for me. Also, at 140 calories for an 8.3 oz can, I thought that was on the high end. But it does contain 34 grams of sugar, and one must remember that fruit juice is not low in calories. I would have preferred more sparkling water and less juice. On the plus side, it has no artificial ingredients or colors. And no corn syrup! I am sure many will like this product more than I, especially those who prefer more sweetness in their beverages. This 8.3 ounce can of carbonated beverage is tangy and tasty. And the slimmer size can means that you are drinking a smaller serving than an ordinary can of soda. But although its 100% juice, it still packs quite the calorie punch. One can is 140 calories, which is almost exactly the same as in a 12 oz. can of regular Coca-Cola! So it may be slightly healthier than drinking Coke since it has no caffeine or high-fructose corn syrup and it has 100% of your requirement of Vitamin C. But its not going to make you as slim and attractive as the packaging! This product is not a soda but a carbonated juice. This soda has a nice taste- its not as sweet and as pure orange-tasting as typical orange soda-like drinks. Its not pure orange juice- but made up of a mixture of several different juices including apple, orange, grape and tangerine.  That juice blend gives it a slightly tangy taste that is actually at first slightly surprising and mostly refreshing.  The carbonation also seems lighter to me than soda but it is definitely there.The things I like about this product are the smaller can size (8.3oz)which makes it a more appropriate serving that a regular soda.  I also like the bright packaging and the pleasant taste.  After reading the ingredients of SWITCH carefully- I see that it is all juice just as it claims- so its probably a better choice than a regular soda.This product has no added sugars just as advertised on the can- but buyer beware- its still kind of high in sugar because fruit juices are naturally high in sugar. As always be sure to read the label if you are concerned about sugar levels.Overall I think this product is a good size and has a pleasant taste- especially if you are looking for something that tastes like an orange juice blend.  Traditional orange soda fans might be slightly disappointed in the taste. I liked the level of carbonation.  It was actually more highly carbonated than I was expecting, but didnt taste dry the way I would expect an artificial-sugar-free drink to taste with carbonation added.  I was hoping it would taste more \"orangey,\" but the tangerine is the more dominant flavor (along with apple, a common juice \"filler\").  Despite having \"no added sugar,\" however, there is still 34 grams worth of it in the small 8.3oz can.  Basically, other than having 100% of the daily value of Vitamin C, this drink could easily be replaced with a better tasting orange soda that is in a 12oz can and costs far less.  Unless you really like the taste, or you want to ensure your Vitamin C beverage stays fresh longer, Id give this one a pass. The logo on the can states \"0% of what you dont want...\" but thats not quite true. Its quite tasty, but loaded with calories.Next time, they need to leave out the sugar as well.Also, this drink isnt readily available. This drink tastes just like soda to me. Very strong and sweetened soda. It reminds me a lot of Fanta back in the day (1970s). I know it says it has all these vitamins and that its healthy, but the flavor and amount of calories would keep me from buying this drink as a \"health drink\". There are plenty of vitamin and flavored waters and sports drinks that would serve the same purpose without all those calories. If I want a soda, I certainly wouldnt pay a lot of money for something that tastes just like it but costs 4 times as much (at a guess). I do love the taste of Fanta, though. Note: This is my first review of a product that is not a book, so please forgive me if I miss something.Im not a huge fan of fruit drinks like The Switch, but I decided to go ahead and give it a shot. After having my first drink, I can honestly say I wanted to hate it. I mean, seriously, Im drinking this can of 100% fruit juice with carbonation and reading all these really stupid quotes all over the can (i.e. \"100% of what I want in a soda, 0% of what I dont\"), wondering how much a 8.3 ounce can of this junk costs (thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.50 or $3.00; and thinking, if I wanted to drink some juice and would drink some juice! I couldnt stop thinking about what is so special about carbonation that I would want to drink this over a glass of OJ. I wanted to scream!However, I kept my cool, and finished the drink. There was something about this particular flavor that was enjoyable, but not engrossing. There was something in the aftertaste that I did not like, and I think it had to do with the tangerine juice. Tangerines arent my bag, either; but it was tolerable.After discussing this product with my wife (I know, this drink apparently also contains the conversation starter attributes, bonus points for that I suppose) she was like, \"this sounds great. Is it like those <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IW25RK\">Izze POMEGRANATE SPARKLING 100% JUICE DRINK</a>??\" I responded: \"Um.... I guess so...\"I then also looked up the price and learned that I had grossly overestimated the price of a single can (being just over a single dollar). Despite my wanting to hate this product, Ive decided to step out of my anti-contemporary culture box, view this product for what it is, and give it a middle rating of 3 stars.I can see the attraction; I can see the appeal; I just wont ever buy it. Ill stick to my glass of Orange Juice and Tang any day.Good drinking,J.Stoner You know what one of my favorite sounds is? The sound of a can opening. I think its weird, consider Im not a huge soda drinker...since I find most sodas too be way too sweet or sugary.This is a review for an Orange Tangerine drink from Switch. Ive never heard of them, but I was feeling kind of thirsty so I ordered a can from the vine program. Its an 8.3 ounce can of 100% carbonated juice (plus gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascborbic acid and soy). I dont know what to think about some of the ingredients, but I certainly do know that I like: that its only 8 ounces and that it has no corn syrup!It tastes very similar to canned Minute Maid drinks, especially the Vallencia Orange offering...but does have a slightly sickly sweet aftertaste.  I dont know if Id run out and buy a 24 pack, but if I saw this in a restaurant Id definitely consider it as a tasty complement to a sandwich and potato chip lunch.The last thing I like is about the company: it seems to be an independently owned shop, and I like that. 100% of what you want, 0% of what you dont is proudly emblazoned upon the can that contains Switchs Orange Tangerine carbonated juice. It certainly tasted all-natural, as there wasnt too much taste really.Dont get me wrong, it was all right, but I would say it tasted kind of like Sprite with a couple of orange flavored Alka-Seltzers tossed in. Another note is that it is rather small at only just over 8 ounces. However, it still had enough orange taste I suppose, so if you want an all-natural mild orange flavored carbonated juice drink, then youve just hit the jack-pot!If not, you may want to pass this up, mildly recommended. One of my favorite but rare indulgences is a can of orange soda; so I was looking forward to the combination of bubbles and orange flavor when I popped open my can of Switch Orange Tangerine. To my disappointment, it tasted more like fruit punch, perhaps because of the apple and grape juices in it to sweeten it. I would say the makers of this drink went overboard on the apple-grape combo, not just in the flavor department, but in the sweetness. Its sticky icky sweet, more than any of the cheaper brands (Sunkist, Crush and others) of orange soda, or the higher priced goodies like Orangina and the delectable Izze.It is fairly healthy however, with no bad stuff and quite a lot of Vitamin C (100% based on 2,000 calorie intake), All Natural, etc. My recommendation is for more orange, less apple/grape, or change the label flavor to \"mixed fruit.\" Its 140 calories per cute little 8.3 oz can, and if youre not expecting orange you may like it. So far, the taste winner for cute little cans for me is Izzes Grapefruit, which has the perfect balance of flavor and carbonation, with the right amount of sweetness. The drink is 100% juice concentrate reconstituted with carbonated water.  It tastes like a cross between <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GN4OHK\">Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans</a> and the orange drink from McDonalds.It was refreshing at first, but the aftertaste is abrupt and almost chemically.  Its odd, because the drink doesnt have any unnatural flavors, according to the ingredients list.  If the end flavor was more natural, I would definitely buy it again. The Switch Orange Tangerine presents  an alternative to ordinary soft drinks, offering one- hundred percent of what you want in a drink and zero percent of what you dont want; or so the manufacturer claims. This is a newer brand of beverage and it follows a trend toward healthier alternatives for every day foods and drinks- a trend that has been gaining steam as more and more individuals look for ways to improve their health.This beverage offers a taste that is refreshing, but slightly different than what I expected. Yes, you get to experience the taste of juicy oranges and tangerines, but there are other flavors present as well and I couldnt quite put my finger on these other flavors until I read the ingredients and discovered that The Switch Orange Tangerine is also made with apple and grape juices. The grape is barely noticeable, but the apple can be detected and it, along with added soy, is responsible for the interesting taste sensation that you experience in the aftertaste.The Switch Orange Tangerine is billed as a health drink and it does, indeed, have many positive selling points in terms of composition and nutrition. There is no added sugar, no artificial colors, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. The beverage is also gluten- free and provides one- hundred percent of the USRDA for Vitamin C and twenty percent of the USRDA for Vitamin A. There is no fat and no protein, either. But there are thirty- four grams of sugars and a fairly high level of calories. Granted, these are natural sugars but thirty- four grams is still a large amount and it wont be acceptable to those on low carb diets.  And with almost seventeen calories per ounce, the caloric content is higher than that of most soft drinks.So, are there enough reasons to make the switch to The Switch Orange Tangerine? My answer is yes, due to both its good, refreshing taste and its better than average nutritional content. It isnt the greatest tasting orange beverage I have ever tried and it is more expensive than most other drinks, including regular orange juice. But it does have enough positive points to earn it a recommendation. Sorry, but I just dont \"get it\".  You pay almost a buck for 8.3oz (just over a cup) of carbonated water and fruit juice concentrate.  FYI, the first one listed on the can is Apple. . . then Grape. . . then Tangerine. . . then Orange.  The taste is fine, but personally, I would much rather have a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice. .  .for a lot less $$. The can is small and cylindrical, like an energy drink, but theres nothing in this to give you a \"boost\".  FYI, there are 140 calories in one can.  If you have the $$ to spend, then yes, its a tasty beverage.  But its simply not a good value in my book. The Switch Orange Tangerine drink is one of the many beverages out there that are trying to offer soda drinkers a slightly healthier alternative without sacrificing the flavor.  No mistake should be made to think that Switch is primarily a fruit drink.  Although it contains 100% juice, Switch is a soda first and a fruit beverage second.  The carbonation, combined with the various citrus flavors, make Switch taste a bit like Mountain Dew with an extra orange kick.Soda fans who like Mountain Dew but want something made of juice should love Switch, as it does offer a slightly healthier alternative to the standard carbonated drink.  Since there are so many fruit juices present each can has 100% of the daily recommended Vitamin C and 20% of the daily recommended vitamin A.  The lack of artificial preservatives does also give it a slightly more crisp taste.Its important to note that Switch isnt \"sugar free,\" but rather has \"no sugar added.\"  The distinction is missed by many, and could be very important for diabetics or anyone watching their sugar intake.  The drink actually has 34 grams of sugar in each can, but since its coming from the fruit juice and not from high fructose corn syrup its less of a problem for anyone looking for a more healthy drink.The biggest factor in deciding if Switch will be worthy anyones time depends entirely on how much they enjoy carbonated citrus drinks.  Soda fans who want a fruitier and less artificial drink will probably love Switch.  People who just want fruit juice and dont enjoy the carbonated flavor should probably avoid, however. In fact, I did not like the artificial taste in this orange drink. The degree of carbonation is alright and it does have an \"orangey\" taste to it. But I cannot ignore the artificial taste that accompanies this beverage. For now, I would stick with plain orange juice or other orange sodas like \"Crush\". As the title of my review indicates this product is nothing special in terms of taste. Granted it is missing some of the soda pop bad guys (high fructose syrup and coloring)but the taste is mediocre. This is not something you are going to rave about because of the taste. If you are a health food junkie you might overlook the bland middle of the road taste. Contrary to some reviews I did not find the drink exceptionally sweet but than again everyone has different taste buds. I am not a soda pop drinker so that might have some influence on my less than enthusiastic endorsement. I was switched off. Will this make you give up your favorite soda pop? Probably not. I like the idea of homemade soda water infused juice for that perky fizzing drink better than Switch. Not such a great product in my opinion. There are things that I recall from my childhood that I would rather not - being stung by a bee, chicken pox, all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before I actually learned to ride it, and Tang.  Tang was that chalky, never quite dissolved in the water, powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as Kool-aid.  It wasnt Kool-Aid by any stretch of the imagination - it was Tang.  Ive never heard anyone ASK for Tang... it was just what was there.So I get my can of Switch in the mail, eyeball the can... its the same size and shape as an energy drink can... one of those \"single shot\" type cans.  Fearing that it was an energy drink I checked the label... says its pretty much all juice, carbonation, and some natural flavors (including soy?!?) so I pop it open and take a swig.Now it MAY be 100% natural juices with some natural flavoring - but I know Tang when I taste it.  This is carbonated Tang... I know it is.  Somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered Tang and someone thought to themselves - what do we do with all of this stuff?  I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now its not Tang, its Switch!In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink - but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can - I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.Pros- Pretty much all natural - Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).Cons- I personally didnt care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink. Overall the drink was decent. Its tart and sweet at the same time. Switch is alright but might not be worth the money depending on how much you like it. I myself would prefer a Spicy V8 over this. It might be a good substitute for some who dont want to drink as much soda, but for me ill just stick with the v8 and the occasional soda. This product has a nice smooth taste with the additional tanginess of tangerine.It also has a little bit of a sweetness to it but syrupy sweet.Not lingering or noticeable aftertaste. When I first glanced at this item, my first thought was a Nehi orange-type soft drink.  However, it is made of 100% fruit juice with carbonation added.  It tastes way too sweet for my taste buds, much more than regular OJ.  In fact, it left an aftertaste in my mouth and I had to brush my teeth right after taste-testing it.I ended up mixing the rest with a shot of vodka and it made a great screwdriver with a kick of carbonation. I enjoyed the product very much.  I like that it is not overly sweet or heavy.  There is no aftertaste and it goes down smoothly with just enough carbonation to give it body.The tangerine/orange taste I found to be clean.  If you like something that is sweeter, this might not be for you.  But if you enjoy the fruity taste with some carbonation it is quite nice.  I drank it chilled.  I dont think I would have enjoyed it at room temperature.The price might keep me away.  Almost a dollar per 8oz can is kind of tough.Four stars for taste and two stars for price = three stars. Switch markets itself as an alternative to soda.  It is essentially carbonated fruit juice with no added sweeteners.  I do agree that if you are a person who drinks a lot of soda or have  child who does, switching to his would be the better alternative.BUT - this drink is not healthy by any means, the amount of fruit juice required for its tastiness results in a HIGH sugar and calorie content for a fruit juice.  You would not want to drink 5 of these in a day and the better option would be a piece of fruit with less calories and sugar. This soda sounded like a good idea, but it is just too sweet. The orange and tangerine juice is clear and bitter tangy but the sugar in this particular flavor is overwhelming to me. (On the other hand I liked the cherry very much.) I would drink it anyway, if it were offered, it certainly is not terrible. But I would not buy it again. I really enjoyed the Switch.  It was a lot more carbonated than most sodas and stayed that way until I finished it.  I was also surprised that no sugar was added since it was sweet and had real crisp, tangerine taste.  It was similar to Sunkist pop but it tasted more like real juice.  I enjoyed the taste and if you have the extra money and want a healthier alternative, you might want to give it a try, but it is still 140 calories per can.  So it isnt exactly a diet drink.  And the price for the Switch is about 4 times the cost of most soft drinks so I think it would be out of the range for most peoples pockets. \"Switch `Orange Tangerine\" is advertized as 100% juice with carbonation.  They were accurate as far as the 100% juice and (light) carbonation goes, but imagine my disappointment when I checked the ingredients, and I read the following: \"100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice concentrates)...BTW - acerola is also known by the common names Barbados cherry and wild crapemyrtle. Its a berry that has extremely high amounts of Vit C.Anyway, back to the drink.  When I ordered this item I was expecting a carbonated \"orange tangerine\" drink, but that was not the taste I got.  After all, tangerine and orange are present in smaller amounts than grape and apple juices.  As a result this drink had a flavor more like a mixture of sparkling grape and sparking apple combined, with somewhat of a light citrus twist, but less carbonation than either sparkling grape or sparkling apple have.The overall flavor of \"Switch\" was all right, but it was not, in my opinion \"orange tangerine\" at all.  In that respect this drink was a great disappointment.  The manufacturer would have been more accurate to name this drink \"fruit punch\" or \"fruit cocktail\" or perhaps \"grape-apple\".  There is, by the way, already a \"fruit punch\" version...I wonder whats in that flavor thats not in this one?The can size is just adequate at 8.3 oz, but is, I would say, fairly expensive at nearly $1/can, especially when its not what you thought you were getting.The drink does, to its credit, have 100% of the recommended daily amount of Vit C, and has only natural juices in it.  That is probably true, but...THIS IS NOT A DIET DRINK.  Just because the can says \"no sugar added\", that doesnt mean that theres no sugar in it.  There happens to be a significant amount of sugar in this drink (given the total volume you get/can)...if I recall correctly the contents label said 35g of sugar.  Thats because 100% fruit juice is loaded with sugar, sugar like fructose.OK, frankly, the taste combo doesnt particularly appeal to me, thats why I didnt order the grape version of this product, and now that I know whats in the \"orange tangerine\" I wouldnt order it again.Im torn between 2 and 3 stars though, simply because its not really an orange-tangerine drink as advertized.  I guess Ill have to go with 2 stars.  (I dont know why 3 stars showed up for this product!?)  Alas... How can tang be lugubrious?  If you made it a bit watered down, a bit more aftertasty, a bit less child-friendly.  Its an all right soda, but I dont feel the thrill of drinking it that I did drinking tang as a child.  I cant pretend Im an astronaut with this.  Sometimes, advertising just helps. Taste like tang, only more expensive.  Im not a fan of tang.  If you love tang and want some convenience, this just might be the drink for you. Sadly, I was supposed to receive this product, but never did.  I imagine its good given the others Ive tried, but alas, that wont happen.  Still, I have to write a review, so there you go. Heres yet another carbonated juice drink, comparable with OOBA Hibiscus With Orange, 16 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 12) & <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C\">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  This one, however, is an unusual combination of orange & tangerine.  I didnt really like the flavor much though I like both orange & tangerine separately.  But, the taste is in the bud (s).  I prefer the Izze of the 3.  As for the juice, its more apple/grape than orange/tangerine & the Vit. C is the silly recommended dose--to prevent scurvy--not much really (per Linus Pauling).  True, it doesnt have corn syrup/sugar/or substitutes--which is nice.  But, at close to $1/8.3 oz its equivalent to about $1.50 for 12 oz (in a pack of 24 small cans).  Seems pricey to me--why not just buy orange juice? The advert for Switch describes it as a \"healthy alternative to soda\" and \"a perfect balance beween juice and carbonation.\" To get right to it, let us tackle the first claim. The can of Switch I got (Orange Tangerine) was 8.3 fluid ounces. Those 8.3 ounces contain 36g carbs, 34g sugars and 15g sodium and packs 140 calories. To put this in perspective, the 20 fluid ounce bottle of vanilla Coke sitting on my desk right now  contains 28g carbs, 28g sugars and 25mg sodium, and has 100 calories. In other words, a bottle of conventional soda 2.5x as large has less calories, less carbs, and less sugars. Granted, Switch has less sodium, but if we poured equivalent amounts of drink, i.e. 20 oz vs. 20 oz, it would have much more. The drawing power of Switch, then, is that it boasts 100% RDA of Vitamin C and 20% RDA of Vitamin A vs 0% in these categories for Coke, and that it has plenty of carbonation to satisfy the taste of soda-lovers. In my mind this doesnt quite balance the scaleAs to the second claim: I liked the balance between a fruit juice and a carbonated drink. It reminded me of Orangina in that it is sharp and crisp and has a bite to it, but it might strike some as too sugary-sweet. All in all I think this is likely to be one of those drinks that people like very much or no at all, no in-betweens. However, it can be considered \"healty\" only in small doses (one can day, say) and should be avoided by low-carb dieters. This product is tasty -- its carbonated juice (a blend of several juices, mostly apple, grape, tangerine). But the 8.3 ounces costs $1 and contains 140 calories. This is a little rich for me, both economically and calorically. I would recommend this for someone who doesnt mind spending their money and calories on juice. Switch Orange Tangerine is ok but not what one might expect.  First of all, there is more apple and grape juice in here than orange or tangerine (this will not be a surprise if you are familiar with the other flavors as that is also true with them).Switch basically is carbonated juice.  The taste isnt a bad and it is supposed to be healthier than soda (which can be debated).  It is a reasonable drink for snacks but if you are going to need several if you are actually thirsty. I think the Switch is a beverage with soda replacement in mind.  The can boasts it contains 100% of what one wants (being all natural, 100% juice, full daily serving of vitamin C, and the clincher, carbonated), while having 0% of what you dont want (no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or colors.)The Good - So with that in mind, I have to agree that it is refreshing to see companies trying to fill the void in \"sodas\" with no corn syrup, with tons of juice and vitamins to boot.  I like that you get a full dose of vitamin C, and a little bit of A.  As for taste, it has a nice slightly crisp bite of carbonation, and its very orange tangerine-y.  Its a little heavy (read syrupy without being too sweet), but it does have a reconstituted juice base, so it gets a pass.  Its also in a single serving-size can (8.3oz), which is nice considering I typically treat most 20oz bottles as a serving, even though its 2 and a half and I tend never do the math to figure out the true content of what Im drinking.The Bad - The price is a bit steep.  At about a dollar a can, its roughly twice the price as most 100% juices you can find, including most selections of orange juice.  Whereas a 64 ounce carton of Tropicana will run you upwards of four dollars, 8 cans of the Switch would cost eight bucks.  For soda lovers, the Switch is about twice the cost compared to your average 20oz bottle, and roughly 4 times the cost of cans (when comparing equal amount by the ounce.)  Also, read the ingredients, it contains more apple and grape juice than orange or tangerine, which means that the taste is probably aided by the natural flavors (which doesnt mean oranges, just that it was derived from natural substances not chemically made.)The Ugly - The Switch seems straight forward, but its also a little devious which leads me to my biggest complaint.  Granted its all natural, but each 8oz can contains 36g of carbs, 34 of sugar alone.  Thats more sugar than soda, in some cases by almost 10 grams a serving.  More sugar (even if its not corn syrup) is more calories per can, so even at its single serving size youd almost be better off drinking a Coke and taking a vitamin C pill. Its a small drink at just 8.3 ounces but thats probably the size drink we should all be consuming so I wont ding it on that point. Its made with good ingredients and as it says `No Sugar Added but dont let that fool you into thinking its low in sugar having 34 grams. A Coke contains 45g of sugar but its almost 50% larger so even without adding sugar this is a drink thats fully loaded. In defense of The Switch at least the sugar is natural with no high fructose corn syrup. Obviously it has no caffeine which I have some issues with so thats a plus over soda although at 36g of carbs it seems a bit high and 140 calories is nothing to sneeze at.So it cant be considered a health drink since you can get lower sugar, carbs and calories from a similar size glass of Tropicana orange juice. So how is the taste? My wife described it as tasting like soap. I wouldnt go that far but I will say the despite its good ingredients it actually tasted artificial to me. I wasnt a big fan and personally Im going to stick with water and orange juice.... and beer. It has a nice taste.  Good for sipping.  If you drink soda or juice with your meals, this would be a decent alternative.  The tangerine taste is pronounced but not overpowering.  The carbonation is pleasant.However, its not a drink I would normally imbibe.  I normally drink either water or beverages sweetened with something other than sugar.  And this has a LOAD of sugar.  Yes, they say it has no added sugar.  Thats probably accurate.  But the natural sugar in the apple/tangerine/orange juices in this drink adds up to 34 grams.  Compare that to the same amount of Coke at 27 grams!  I checked a few other tangerine flavored sodas - they all had similar amounts of sugar as Switch.  I suppose tangerines are loaded with sugar.  Anyway, thats a lot more sugar than I normally drink.If the sugar isnt an issue, this is worth checking out. Switch is a decent soda, and definitely worth considering for those who want mainly natural ingredients. But I think it is overstating it a bit when the Switch can claims \"100 % of what you want and 0 % of what you dont want\" - or is soy something I would expect or want in a soda?For my personal taste, this Switch flavor (which was the only one I tried) was too sweet. It is hard to believe that there is no sugar added to that stuff.So - ok, but not great. I prefer <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NU4VSO\">Izze Sparkling Pomegranate Soda 4 Pk (4-12 ounce bottles)</a> or any of the Izze flavors over Switch. A nutritionist once told me she could find something good about every food...except soda. Pop is full of CO2 (carbon dioxide), something our body is trying to get rid of, and refined sugar (which can ruin the teeth and provides empty calories). But even so, I still love it. I love the fizz tingling down my throat while while cleaning my palate and replacing it with sweetness. Nutri-sweet brings down the calories at the expense of flavor and has side effects like headaches and giving me a gnawing hunger.For fun occasions, Ill mix lemon-lime or plain soda water with juices for a delightful, and slightly healthier alternative to soda. Will the Switch Orange Tangerine soda live up to my expectations? A carbonated juice in a can?At first glance, the Switch can is...cute. Its a slender can with nice artwork. Fun to hold in your hand when youre used to the typical can.But when I taste it, Im sorry to say, Im a little disappointed. The Orange Tangerine Switch soda is not as tasty as regular orange soda, nor as orange juice. For a disclaimer, Ill mention that orange juice is not something that would normally taste great carbonated, so the other flavors of Switch might taste better. I got a kind of odd, bitter taste as I drunk the soda, but afterwards there was a pleasant aftertaste. The bitterness might be present in regular soda, but this is orange juice (with some others mixed in) and I know how it tastes without carbonation.I gave the Switch soda to both of my daughters who happily swigged it down with no concern from the odd taste I noticed.So while I wont be happily exchanging my occasional soda for Switch, Im glad they are trying to do something a little healthier than we can feel more comfortable giving our children. And really, on a hot day, this would hit the spot. I gave this a try because I love carbonated juice-stuff like bottled cranberry, apple, grape from Welchs and the like.Personally I liked this pretty well, though not as much as some other brands.  To me, it tastes and smells like tangerine, and I felt like I could kind of taste some of the component flavors making it up-the flavor is more complex than youd get from a fruit flavored soda.  The carbonation is pretty lightI definitely wouldnt mind trying some of `The Switchs other flavors...BUT, I split some of the tangerine flavor with a relative, and she thought it smelled like Jell-O, and didnt care for it-she said shed rather have regular juice.I definitely liked this better than orange soda though! If you like your drink not so smooth and a bit \"tangy\"...this should work for you ....but... alas! ... not for  me.. The product description says that its \"just juice, bubbles and vitamin C.\" Really, its just the last two. Its not entirely flavorless, but Ive tasted plenty of beverages that are much better than this one with a lot less carbonation.And, honestly, this \"healthy\" drink is rather easily replaced by a multivitamin pill. Its not really good for you, its just not directly bad for you. Sincerely, Im fairly sure that sucking on my couch cushions would garner you more nutrition than a Mountain Dew, so its not like \"better than soda\" is really setting the bar high.Rather disappointing, particularly compared to the other Switch beverages. First, I wish I had gotten two can samples of this product so I could try one with some bourbon. I find almost everything mixes with bourbon except tomato juice.OK. What I liked: nice fruit flavor. Strong but not overpowering. The carbonation was OK. Not flat, which was nice. Did not tickle my nose as champagne does.I did not care for the \"can\" taste. I felt there was a slight metallic aftertaste. Really, that was the only thing I didnt like. This product would probably taste better in glass rather than aluminum. Maybe I am overly picky...Overall, not sure I liked it enough to order it again. I think I liked a similar drink but this one is just there. Its bubbly. Its sort of orange flavored. It has a sharpness but theres nothing about it that excites me. Its a good old fashioned carbonated beverage and if its inexpensive buy it. If its significantly more expensive than most drinks, leave it. Buy coke instead. This is a beverage that is different from the other beverages out there.  It starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet.  I was hoping for the zing to continue or get more full but it died.The overall taste is not as sweet as an orange soda and not as citrus as an Izze or similar citrus beverage.Overall, this is in between and as such is not going to be my pick as I will usually want one or the other.Not bad, but not what I want. SWITCH isnt a bad product, but its not great either. I like the fact that its all natural sparkling juice, and the can design is pleasant to look at.The orange tangerine isnt bad; this flavor isnt as syrupy as some of Switchs others.  However, at 140 calories per can, this beverage has 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda. Too many for me. Its not bad. Good ingredients for a change so thats a plus. Taste is okay but not great. I would drink it if offered, but doubt Id buy it. I sampled this product with some reservations. Carbonated fruit juice? My wife said that it would probably be something like Orangina, but since Im not particularly fond of Orangina that didnt help me much. I then remembered that I had no problem drinking sparkling grape juice so this might not be so bad after all. I sampled this product cold, as warm fruit juice and warm soda are both bad ideas no matter what the flavor.I was very surprised to discover that I enjoyed this quite a bit. I expected there to be some acidity to it, given the orange and tangerine combination, and found none. I did find it surprisingly sweet considering that theres no added sugar. It was not, in fact, entirely unlike your garden variety orange soda with a smoother finish. There was a slight and very brief metallic aftertaste which I first assumed was from drinking it right from the can, but after a second taste from a drinking glass the aftertaste remained. Still, its not enough to put me off from drinking it.The one thing that did put me off was the price. Ill admit that Im something of a \"cheap drinker\" - I have a hard time, for example, going to the grocery store and buying a half gallon of lemonade for $2.50 when I can buy a $2 bottle of lemon juice and a $2.50 bag of sugar and make two gallons of lemonade and still have three pounds of sugar left over. I *always* do the math and price out what Im drinking. (Do you have ANY idea how much money Coke makes off those 20 oz bottles?!?) So for this product, $23 for a 24-pack comes out to 96¢ per 8.3 ounce can, or about 12¢ per ounce. A half gallon of Tropicana orange-tangerine juice at the local supermarket is $3.80, or about 6¢ per ounce. I happen to have a carbonator and chargers are about 40 cents apiece, and it would take 2-3 chargers to do the entire half-gallon, so all said and done it would cost me about 8¢ per ounce to make my own carbonated orange-tangerine drink, so its about 2/3 the cost to make it myself. (No, I didnt factor in the cost of the carbonator itself so that could be considered loading the dice.)So I guess the bottom line here is, if youre really big on the whole carbonated orange-tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed, or you can make a very close approximation of it yourself for about 65% of the cost (assuming you have a carbonator). Or, you can buy a two liter bottle of house-brand orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about $22 in the process. Energy Drinks are very popular these days.  Most, if not all, are loaded with sugar, various overloads of vitamins, and varying \"energy blends.\"  A few energy drinks have tried adding pure juice, but have only come up with 50% at most.If your not a youngun and cant handle that blast of sugar and crash that follows, then Switch is a better alternative.  Switch is 100% juice, ZERO sugar, and lots of vitamin C.Switch is carbonated, so with the Orange Tangerine flavor, picture your morning juice with a little soda fizzle.  The taste is sweet, but not sugary.  Although the size of the can probably relates to the recommended serving, most people probably dont have this little juice in one sitting.Soda fizzle meets juice benefits.  Its a no brainer.  How about some more flavors? I was looking forward to this tea, but unfortunately the mint overpowers the hibiscus and essentially makes this just another kind of mint tea.  I prefer the hibiscus tart be the star of the show in a hibiscus-based tea (aka \"herbal infusion\") and in my opinion, mint and \"tropical\" dont mix and now know going forward to pay more attention to the ingredients.  Still worth 3 stars because it can be a refreshing tea on a hot day, but just not a great tropical/hibiscus tea. Work well and made solidly.  For whatever reason the Keurig takes longer to complete the brewing cycle when using these cups and the liquid bleeds through the filter on the outside of the cup making a small mess.  They do the job as intended but could use a different type of filter to make the experience less messy. Disposakups....great idea, because K-kups are expensive and arent necessarily available in your favorite coffee.Disposakups fit well into the Keurig coffee maker, the lid snaps on firmly to the disposakup after you fill it with your favorite coffee or tea.  However, the problem comes with the filter which wicks the hot coffee under pressure out of the disposakup from under the lid.I tried several of these disposakups. After the first few leaked I thought maybe I was not snapping the lid on tight enough, so I made up some more disposakups and made sure the lids were on REALLY tight, no gaps! They still leaked about 5 or 6 drops from each disposakup, which then drips outside the k-kup holder chamber...and outside the catch area.  I needed to clean up around the coffee maker after use.I give this item 3 stars because they do work, and are a great idea, but the design of the filter protruding from around the cap causes the leaking.  If you dont mind a bit of cleanup after each use....youll appreciate these.Ill use the rest of the box, and continue cleaning up after each use, but I wont buy more.The seller offered a refund, but it would cost me almost as much to send them back as I would receive as a refund. work OK. main problem they leak out the top a bit as well as inside the machine.  is it worth the extra work?  it is if you want to pay a fraction of the cos of a k-cup.  plus you can use any coffee you desire. Nice idea...to create self-filling cups for those who own Keurig Brewers but want to use their own bagged coffee, or those who do not want to incur the high cost of purchasing pre-made brewing cups.  The idea is, one takes a plastic cup, puts in the pre-molded filter, adds ones own coffee grounds, closes the cup with the lid and then pops the cup into the brewer, disposing of it at the end.  However...the plastic on the cups is a bit flimsy, such that if one pushes too hard down on the lid, the entire cup collapses, accordion style...another drawback is that the lids do not fit snugly without careful maneuvering, so that it can take longer than one might expect to close the cups...these two problems defeating the purpose of \"fast\" which is basically the primary advantage of Keurig brewers in the first place.  Another advantage of the brewer is the lack of a mess, which these cups also do not address well....there is always coffee left to either drip down or on top of the lid following brewing which requires cleanup of the cup holder...granted it is not major clean-up, but nevertheless...  And finally, the potential advantage of cost savings...the cups appear to be relatively inexpensive, but add in the cost of shipping and handling, which is some $6 on top of the featured price (about 50% more), and the per cup price increases...try purchasing multiple packages to reduce shipping cost...no go, the company just doubles the cost of shipping one package; ergo, if you were to say order 100 cups, you would pay more than 30 dollars and a third would be shipping and handling.  In addition to the other problems with the design, it more or less defeats the purpose.  Large packages of the pre-made pods can be purchased for nearly the same per-pod cost.  Would not recommend these, until the company lowers shipping costs, improves design, or both.  Youre better off just using the mesh filter pod that comes with your brewer, and simply rinsing it out...same time involved, less cost and lower environmental impact. These cups work for the most part except for the fact that all most all of them leak out the top of the cap. All seem to wick some leakage through the paper filter at the cap and cup joint and approximately 10-15% overflow and leak around the cup and down the sides providing some grounds with the coffee. I like the DisposaKups.  If Im fixing more than one cup, its quicker to use the DisposaKups than it is to clean out the refillable holder, which came with my machine. I was very excited to see a product such as this being offered on line, as I loved the coffee I was drinking before I got a Keurig.  (My previous coffee is not offered in a K-cup version.)  Very promptly I placed an order and couldnt wait for it to arrive. I placed my fresh beans into my grinder and ground them a little courser than I would have if I was using my Bunn coffee pot.  I then proceeded to place the filter into the disposable K-cup, add my freshly ground beans and placed the cap on tightly.  Great!! Ready to brew my first cup of my favorite coffee.  The whole procedure worked well until the cycle was almost finished and then it happened.  Scalding hot water started squirting out of my Keurig machine from all sides.  I was trying to move my cup to catch the water, but it was coming out too fast and very hot.  I was disappointed with the performance of this product.  The coffee was good, although not a full cup and I had a mess to clean. I have tried grinding the beans finer and courser, also tried to fill the cups at different levels, but the results are still the same.  I will continue experimenting with the disposable K-cups and if I find the right combination, I will let you know. Product is, as advertised, a good way to utilize your own coffee blends.  It is easy to fill and prepare for use, however, it sometime leaks at the end of the brewing process. It is difficult to judge the amount and grind of coffee to put in the K-cups. If it is too fine a grind or is too packed full it only give you a half of a cup. I recently purchased DisposaKups from this seller! Not only did I receive great customer service and fast shipping, but my product came packaged perfectly. I absolutely love the idea of the DisposaKups. However, after using a few, they just dont live up to my expectations. The lid often gets stuck in the keurig when its done brewing, sometimes the holes dont poke properly, and every time i am left with water spewing out in all directions while it brews. Definitely not a replacement for MyK or Solofill. I purchased this product for a couple of reasons.  First, with the cost of k-cups, this offered a lower price option.  Second, this allows me to used the coffee of my choice (decaf, organic, water-processed).The first couple of times I used these, the coffee was very weak.  I opened a regular k-cup that I had to see if there was a difference in grind size from what I was using; there was not.  Then I poured the contents of the k-cup into my disposable k-cup and it would not fit.  Apparently, the disposable cups hold less coffee, which could account for the weakness.  I also noticed that the disposable cups leak around the rim, and I often get grounds in my cup.I started packing as much coffee as I could into the cups, to where I could barely get the top on.  This made a much better cup of coffee.  However, they still leaked, there were still grounds in my coffee, and it make my Keurig run MUCH slower.  Not to mention the cleanup...My business uses a Keurig so that all of us can brew the coffee of our choice, and we also have a couple of tea and hot chocolate drinkers.  Everytime I use the disposable cups, I have to wipe down the machine, drip tray & my cup.  I also have to clean out the interior of the cup recepticle so that the next person doesnt have to put up with my leftovers.  All in all, these were a nice idea, but the amount of work they require makes paying a little exta for the convenience of regular k-cups more attractive.  I will probably use up what I have and then go back to the regular k-cups or find a more landfill friendly solution. They look like a good idea.  My wife and I thought we would give them a try.  They are pretty easy to use.  The thing we dont like is the mess they make in the machine.  Even when to top is secure, they leak into the machine. You have to keep cleaning the filter basket or it gets sticky.  I would advise you to use something better like the E-Z Cup. Looking at all the disposable/reusable K-Cup designs I think I will forgo purchasing any at this time and continue to use my tried and true *free* method.*Free after the cost of an original K-Cup.After using your K-Cup filled with coffee that youve purchased:Take off the aluminum lid that seals the top.Empty grounds into the trash or compost.Rinse out the inside.  You will see there is already a filter inside.Fill with your own coffee.Place a small square of aluminum foil on top and be sure to make it tight and sealed around the top edges of the cup.Now reuse your cup a few times or many, its up to you as long as the filter holds up.  Just re-do all the steps for each cup you make. We use the K-caps so that we can re-use our K-cups by refilling them with the coffee we like.  We have lost or given away several of the caps over the 2 years that weve been using them; so I thought I would buy some more K-caps.  It turns out, the prices for them have increased substantially; so I went in search of another alternative that would be less expensive.  I found these and thought I had found the answer; but they dont quite work as well as the original K-cups.  They actually caused the Keurig to spew water in directions other than the intended direction and then allowed enough coffee grounds to escape that the holder for the cups became clogged and had to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned before it could be used again.  Good idea - but not quite right. This is what is needed to use with finely ground coffees. It works well. With none fine ground coffee I prefer using my Solo Fill Cups they are easier to use. I have had six for some time and have had no problem except when using fine ground coffee. Neat concept. Other contraptions to use your own coffee have prepunched holes and are designed much differently than the K-Cup. This is like a do it yourself K-Cup. However, because this consists of a disposable cup, filter, and a cap and is punched by the brewer, I would not be surprised if this mechanism infringed on Keurigs patents. Oh, and the video review submitted by the other reviewer looks suspiciously like the video on the manufacturers website :) I recieved my DiposaKups and was a little disappointed.  First, they took quite awhile to arrive in the mail, however when I was tracking the product, it did say that it would take some time to deliver.  I have the Keurig Cuisinart, and the cups work ok, but they dont allow the machine to finish the brewing process.  It doesnt allow the hinge to completely close, which wont let the machine complete the brewing.  I have to take the cup out in order for it to finish.  HOWEVER, it is very convenient and makes it much more cost effective, but I dont know that I would buy them again because Im worried I may ruin my machine. Im not happy with these reusuable cups ! They dont hold enough coffee so when using the Keuring system, I get a small cup of coffee intead of the middle button. I hope Keurig comes out with a better reusable k cup holder. I was looking for a simple and inexpensive way to provide my own supply of \"home made\" K-cups. This product is all that it is described to be;fairly easy to use and does not adversely affect the cup of coffee. Clearly, the cups and lids are in fact reusable albeit a little messy.I have used all 50 filters so I am at a point where I need to decide if I want to continue on with this regimen or go to plan B.I am electing to try one of the reusable style cups that dont require the use of a filter. My hope is that it will be a little quicker and less messy to use.However, if plan B does not meet my expectations I can always order another supply of filters and continue on with this DisposaCups system. The cups are a little tight for my machine. You have to press down on the handle really hard. Also the lids dont fit properly unless the filter is pushed down all the way into the cup. Good, easy to use, somewhat hard to get the caps on, but at the end you can easily dispose of these disposable Kups after using.Good that you can use your own coffee.  Fresh coffees.  I personally like coffees from Spain, Puerto Rico and other countries.The bad, sometimes is messy.  Coffee grinds seem to leak, creating a slight mess and the need to clean the machine.  This leak is more in the area of the Kups lid and cup.  And some times these grinds even get in your cup of coffee.  Just read other reviews about this.  Not sure if it could be related to how fine are the grinds of coffee.On the other hand, with disposable Kups you dont need to keep cleaning wire filter baskets.  Thats a very plus.All considered will probably buy again, but wish a better lid/cup seal that will not leak.  Hope down the road they will offer improved DisposableKups. Not thrilled with these.  Doubt I will buy them again.  Lid doesnt fit very well.  Messy and did not make a good cup of coffee.  Cost including shipping to me was .36/filter cup plus coffee. Dont think it is worth it as I can buy a Green Mountain K-Cup for around .54/cup and they are perfect every time. i bought these for my pittie who is on a sweet potato and fish diet.  i thought they would be a little larger, but they are more suitable for a smaller breed dog.  they were even a little small for my pug who gulped them down and i was afraid she would choke on them. My Seth is a huge fan of spicy things, the hotter the better. I was hoping these would go over really well, and be a regular snack. He likes them, but just that. I got him the Ass Kickin Snack Mix, and he devoured it, wolfing it down, so Well stick with that. Id still consider this a great buy if you love peanuts. And its a great price. I am attracted to reliable consumables which do not vary much from batch to batch. I expect the single malt scotch I purchase this month will be similar to the one I bought six months ago, all things remaining the same. In my experience, I have had Ahmad Earl Grey Tea thats knocked off my socks with a rich flavor, filled with the bergamot that attracts me to Earl Grey. The box Im currently drinking is so full of tannin and void of essence of bergamot that I dont know if it will actually be drunk. All boxes Ive had contained tea bags with an ample amount of tea and each produces a satisfactory little teapot full of caramel colored tea, but I am having difficulty drinking the second cups from this box because the tea powder residue remains. Instead of enjoying an afternoon of relaxation, I develop a stomach ache, so Im now skipping the entire second cup.  The tea was recently purchased, so staleness is likely not an issue. My Experience:Its very translucent, with just a light golden color. It smells like youd expect a peach to smell, but the taste hints of a white grape juice, though it has no grape in it and tastes more peachy over time, especially as it warms up. Its tingly on the tongue, but doesnt foam up. Its slightly drier than your average juice, with a hint of bitterness, probably from the carbonation.Did I Like it: Yes, though not as much as their offering in Pomegranate-Apple, a 6 out of 10. My wife doesnt like it so much. They do not taste like a good high quality nut, i dont know if it was the lack of salt but they were not for me I love izze sprarkling juice, it is amazing.  My favorite flavors would have to be apple and blueberry.  I was curious to try the grapefuit one though because someone told me it tastes like fresca, and I love fresca.  I tried it and in no way does it taste like fresca, its much milder then fresca and not a very strong grapefruit flavor at all.  I found it to lack in the grapefruit flavor but more of a peach flavor to be honest.  I have not tried the peach one yet but I am guessing it tastes like the grapefruit one:D lol  Oh well, I am just not a big fan of peach drinks.  If you are someone who likes a milder taste of grapefruit then you will love this, its very smooth.  I dont like very smooth so this is not my favorite, I like my drink to have a bite to it.  It is ok, but I will stick to blueberry and apple from now on. The really awesome thing about these drinks though is they are lower calorie then your normal juice, all natural and no added sugar, and each glass bottle has 2 servings of fruit, you cant beat that. I enjoyed the dry roasted part, but the Onion-Garlic combination was a little overwhelming for me.  I thought that they would be a little more \"toasted\" than they were.  The flavor was more of an after taste and my wife shied away from my kisses after I ate them -- bummer!  I am looking for something else. The flavors are really good but the crackers get a bit slimy as you chew them. If that doesnt bother you, then theyre a great low-carb snack. You know I really do love this product. I wish I could give the tea 5 stars because it really does brew up a very pleasant tasting iced tea that needs little sugar or other embellishments. The problem is its loose and when you  are trying to make a big jug of it with two packets of tea it is a huge mess to strain. And ordinary double mesh strainer is not fine enough. I dont have coffee strainers in the house so I had to line a mess strainer with paper towels and it took forever to strain. But when I strained it with just my mesh strainer there was a ton of tea in the jug. I wish the variety pack came pre-bagged like the smaller boxes of tea do. The pumpkin seeds I received from the Bobs Red Mill company were stale and contained a lot of small seed fragments. Bobs Red Mill Pumkin Seeds came to me in a great box..and inside the box well packaged and extremly secure shelled seeds.I cannot say enough about the quality of the packaging--a really nice thing for me--because it takes some time for me to finish them all--and they stay fresh and secure because of the special care taken in the packaging.The quality of the seeds themselves is very good. They are uniform in appearance...well shaped...appetizing..and healty looking.The price here is totally right for those of us that need more closer to a bulk level of foods. These came in a multipack carton.These are not only items by Bob Red Mills --there are many--and if grains and nuts and seeds are in your diet..your childrens diet or even your pets diet.....then I cannot recommend this line enough to you--for fresh ....healthy eating !Try them ! I made the mistake of thinking that this product was simply Brown sugar flavored Splenda. I didnt read the product details stating that it actually has brown sugar in it.. My mistake... This is not what one should expect from a black truffle, but we are not paying the price for a winter truffle. It is cheap, but there is a reason for that: there is no taste and no smell at all. I was disappointed when I tried this truffle, but I realized that the price was that for a reason. At least it can be used to add a colour to your dish. This is a pretty good cup of tea. I just wish PG Tips made pods for the Keurig brewer.  Maybe eventually! The product was fair, not as \"country\" as I would like, but better than you find in a grocery store. This tea has mostly all raspberry flavours with little to no peach at all.  I added a peach green tea bag when I brew it & a little sweetener.  Its very tough to taste the \"sparkling wine\" flavour, either.  At best, its a nice raspberry green tea, but its certainly not what I was expecting & hoping for.  If I bought it from a store, I would have taken it back. The photo shows potato and carrot pieces in the butternut squash base but upon opening a can, there are no potato or carrot pieces to be found, unlike the cans Ive bought from a local grocery store.  I guess this must be a change in Wolfgang Pucks recipe but the photo on the can does not represent the contents anymore.  Several cans out of the twelve pack were delivered dented, although none seriously.  Packing with better filling could have prevented dents in transit. I had ordered a case of this incredible soup, based on my experience of ordering it at the the Dallas Fort Worth resturant. It was so incredible that I ordered another container to go, couldnt stop thinking about it during my meeting in Dallas and ordered two more before my flight back to California. I went out of my way to go to this terminal so I could order it again.So when I got the canned version....not as impressed. Oh well. Its all natural, no artificial color, no weird ingredients . . . but it also has no taste. The sauce is thin and runny and doesnt have much flavor. If you need a boxed dinner in a pinch, then by all means use a product with natural ingredients. But if you want good mac and cheese, stick with homemade. I ordered this item and was not pleased when it arrived, however the seller promptly contacted me to make things right. They refunded my purchase in full after requesting a photo of the item. Their response was quick and much appreciated. I will likely not purchase plants online any longer, however, if I do, I would not hesitate to consider this seller again mainly because of their customer service. The plant looked great the day it arrived. With that said, the arrival took an extra week to get here. After the first day one of the heads turned blacked and i had to remove it. I give it 4 hours of direct sunlight a day and always keep the media wet. I never use tap water. Only rain and purifies water. I still have yet to see any of the heads open. Im very nervous that they will not ever open. Maybe they will send me another one :/ Its smaller than I expected. I dont think 3 inches is as big as it used to be. It comes in this clear goofy plastic box that told me to use said box as a humidity dome. I dont remember seeing a dome in the little shop movie but I tried it anyway. A day later my plant was burned and never recovered.Id give it more stars if the directions were more clear. It was cool seeing the heads close up on things. The plant came very healthy but smaller then described. It was described as a large Venus fly trap I received a medium size Venus fly trap but it was a healthy one even fed before it was shipped being that I paid a reasonable price for its unexpected size I dont believe I loss on this one in fact I am pleased with the plant. I received the plant in great condition but soon killed it. The directions said not to fertalize it and exactly what to plant it in. So, I bought exactly what it said but did not pay attention to the fact that the medium had rapid gro in it so it died within 3 days. My seven year old loved it while he had it though. He even named it, fed it and took care of it as if it were a life pet! On the label it says, \"1/3 less sugar\" than regular peanut butter.  If you read the fine print, it is because it 1/3 less peanut butter!  That being said, it is very tasty. My golden retriever loves these bones!  I ordered them and they arrived in a timely manner.  However, when I opened the box, they were old - meaning the filling was somewhat dried and didnt completely fill the hoof due to shrinkage.  Once the plastic is removed, the filling pretty much falls out.  Very disappointing! I grew up in NJ and the local Italian food store sold this sauce along with dough and cheese that you could take home to make your own pizza! I loved it then, and I love it now.  The only issue is the price.  At almost 4$ per can it would be hard to justify the cost.  So to be clear, 5 stars for the sauce, but 1 star for the price! I really do not know what the issue is with this goat milk. My one year old daughter has suffered horrible constipation since switching to cow milk on her birthday. After a month of us both suffering (because I had to help it along if you get my drift), I switched her to goat milk. After 2 days, she was passing perfectly soft stools. The goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation, but each can I open seems to be different. Sometimes when I reconsitute it, I know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong. Other cans, I hardly notice it. She will not drink the bad-smelling milk, and when I have tried it, I have nearly vomitted! Majorly salty and gamey tasting.Compared to fresh (Meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store), well, it really doesnt compare. I have found the fresh to taste sweet, like cream, and then there is a little gamey after-taste, but nothing like the slap-you-in-the-face taste of the powdered. I was hoping to save money with the powdered, but since it is a 50/50 chance she wont drink certain cans, I am really wasting money. I am thinking I will have to stick with the fresh from now on.If anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be, I would love to hear it! I always have prepared it with Britta-filtered water (warmed on the stove) and mixed it up in pyrex, then stored it in a large Ball jar in fridge. (I know I should prob call the company and talk to them, but that would require me to actually remember to do it at a time that they are open and I am able - never happens!!)Thanks! I purchased this product in the hope of utilizing it to produce yogurt. The yogurt produced by this product was very thin and could not be thickened using only culture.From the producers website\"Note:  Goat milk yogurt is very thin, almost like kefir. For a thicker consistency, add 1 packet of unflavored gelatin dissolved in some of the scalded goat milk....\"The product has a distinct aroma. Not terrible, but was stronger than comparable fresh goat milk. The flavor of the milk was only acceptable.In a pinch this product will suffice, however; I would not personally recommend it for regular consumption. Its OK,but it is not as good as Meyenbergs fresh goatmilk in the carton.It sort of has a waters down taste.! Others may have a different experience. We were using this as a supplement to mothers milk because mothers milk just did not seem to provide enough fat / protein for baby to gain weight. Problem, although stated that Goats milk is easier to digest, we found that once we mixed the goat milk with mothers milk, she ate more infrequently and got constipated with indegestion. We had bought this to help with digestion, as Formula is based on cows milk. This goats milk seemed to have the opposite effect on our baby, and she didnt gain weight. Also, the taste isnt so great.We can use it as back up, in case we dont have milk in the fridge. So, its OK, but I probably wont buy again. I dont find the taste of this goat milk very pleasing if mixed to use in liquid form; Ive had fresh goat milk and frankly, this does not come anywhere close even with reasonable expectations because of the powered form. It does however have its use in my kitchen in baked goods where the flavor even if slightly sour can be of use. Certain bread, pancakes and the like do very well if I add this mix instead of other milks or water. Good to have in the pantry for those \"just-in case\" days. Ive been drinking/using the fresh Goats milk for years. Ive recently bought the dry milk<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZTS\">Meyenberg Powdered Goat Milk, Vitamin D, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a> in hope of saving a little money. It does taste a little powdery. I cant drink it straight, where I used to with the fresh. I noticed on the Amazon page where it says....customers who bought this also bought....evaporated goats milk<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EY5COG\">Meyenberg Evaporated Goat Milk, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. Im wondering if this makes it creamier or taste better. I hope to get some feedback from those who have tried combining the two and what quantity of dry to what quantity of evaporated? Im trying not to give up on the dry yet.Thank you, Vicki I love Jell-o No Bake Cheesecake but was disappointed the shelf life was so short. I got it after Christmas and the expiration date was April 8,2011.  Had I known that before I ordered I would have never ordered.  12 boxes is a lot to use up in only 3 months. I will not order again. Im rather conflicted about this product. Granted, it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea (like the ones you get at dim sum places) when brewed hot, however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar. It doesnt taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once its iced and combined with sugar. The tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light. I need to double or triple the recommended amount of blossoms to get a decent amount of flavor and by then Im pretty much done with the entire canister. Too pricey for me. My husband says these pretzels are great and he loves them.  However, on the box I saw a warning that says the pretzels are made in a facility that produces peanut butter.  Therefore, I cant eat them.  So for those of you with peanut/nut allergy I would urge caution. In an effort to reverse augmenting high blood pressure, a physician recommended I drink hibiscus herbal tea. Kudos to Celebration Herbals for delivering the tea one day after the order was placed. I followed instructions on the box and used spring water which was  steeped for approximately ten minutes. Although the primary reason for drinking the tea was medicinal, I also wanted a flavorable tea. Sadly the taste of the tea was unexceptional. Accordingly, the next box of hibiscus tea that I purchase will not be from Celebration Herbals. I like the taste, but the store does not always has this.  Some-how it tastes different from the one in the store, much weaker caffeine and aroma... As we all know.....any canned soup, organic or not, should be avoided or at least limited.  It does work for storm supplies due to its easy medium term storage and it being infrequently or never used.  It will end up in a hunting camp for a few days of quick meals toward the end of its shelf life.  Everything tastes better in fresh air and this stuff isnt bad.  Again, its use is very limited.Dont like the BPA issue either.  I did speak to Wolfgang Puck about PBA and their plans.  Like most, they are treading water to see what the government (friends of the fda) does or does not do about it.  Whats a little more poison added to the current mix in processed foods.Ever notice that most of the Wolfgang Puck soup ingredients here on Amazon end at \"Contains 2% or less of the Following\"........?As I indicated above, we did try this soup, and it tasted ok, nothing special.  Try adding a little more sea salt. It is better than the MSG enhanced, preservative laden Campbells brand crap, a brand we would not buy regardless of circumstance.  One never knows who actually made this soup.We consider the organic versions the lesser of (insert remaining cliche), and have a case......in case. The product was fair, not as \"country\" as I would like, but better than you find in a grocery store. I bought this because I was craving dark chocolate, and thought mint sounded great at the time. The chocolate is way too sweet. Dark chocolate is supposed to be a little bitter, not too much, but enough to give it some bite. I guess Ghirardelli decided to cancel that out by adding more sugar. Add to it the super sweet mint filling, and I could barely finish a square it was so sweet. Considering the expense, I expected a much better quality. I use this as a whey/soy protein alternative. I am allergic to soy and have sensitivity to whey and this product seems to be free of both. I actually havent used it as a shake, but I use it to make protein pancakes. I find I have to add extra cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey and stevia to make it more sweet. At first I came out with some really awful pancakes, but after I found the perfect ingredients to doctor it up, they all come out amazing!!! So if your looking for an alternative to whey and soy, I definitely think this is a good choice! I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AS A REPLACEMENT FOR JAY ROBB EGG WHITE PROTEIN SHAKES, WHICH IS WHAT I PREFER BUT DOESNT FIT MY BUDGET - TO EXPENSIVE FOR EVERY DAY USE.  I WAS LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE AND CAME ACROSS THIS.  SINCE ONE OF THE REVIEWS SAID THAT IT WAS SOY FREE I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I DONT HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE TASTE WITH ALL OF MY HEALTH PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT A LOT IN THAT DEPARTMENT.  IT JUST TASTE LIKE WATERED DOWN CHOCOLATE TO ME.  I DRINK IT WITH WATER OR SOMETIMES WITH RICE MILK BECAUSE I NEED THE EXTRA CALORIES ON DAYS THAT I CANT HANDLE SOLID FOODS.  HOWEVER,ON RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, IT DOES CONTAIN SOY. HOW MUCH I COULDNT SAY AS IT WASNT LISTED ON THE INGREDIGENT COLUMN.  I FOUND IT MENTIONED ON THE BACK OF THE LABEL STATING THAT IT CONTAINED SOY LETICHEN(THINK I SPELLED THAT RIGHT).  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH.  IF SOMEONE COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THE INFO. ALSO,I NOTICED THAT IT HAS GONE UP ABOUT $10.00 SINCE I PLACED MY ORDER LAST MONTH,SO IT MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE ANYMORE, BECAUSE THAT PUTS IT ABOUT EVEN WITH WHAT I WAS PAYING FOR THE JAY ROBB EGG WHITE SHAKES. Although it is very high in protein, I thought the vanilla ice cream flavor was very bland. I would not buy this again as it was not tasty enough. Packaging on these leaves something to be desired - last shipment I received had 2 out of 3 boxes with the corners crushed and when I opened the first one and removed the bag, there were a lot of broken biscotti.  I expect it will be the same for the other box that was damaged.  Given that these are fairly fragile, they should be given better protection from being crushed by the shippers.The biscotti themselves are tasty, if a bit small.  I wish they were full-sized, 3 or 4 inches long instead of an inch and a half.  But as I live in a rural area where people think \"biscotti\" is a kind of biscuit, these are a good second choice. Coffee is good but I dont care for individual pacs. Would rather have coffee in bags like their other coffee is packed. I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  Im not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3. These guys are quite high on the nutritional scale but on these marinated morsels varieties, well, they hate them.  They get stuck in my cats teeth and although it can be quite comical watching them afterwards, it just inst worth them only eating about half a can and tossing the rest down the garbage disposal.  I recommend them for the nutritional value and please try them if you cat loves chicken.  My rescue loves many of the other varieties and this stuff has improved her quality of life tremendously. Recommend! I have 4 cats, and none of them really like these treats. They will eat them eventually, but the certainly dont go wild for them. I do like that grain and chicken free, so they are good for cats with allergies. I really wanted my 2 yr old cat to like these treats because I already feed her Wellness wet food, which is excellent by itself. Perhaps shes too used to the Whiskas Temptations that I normally give her, but she did not like the jerky bits at all. I did notice it was hard for her to pick up because theyre pretty flat, and the texture is chewier than what shes used to. The 3rd time I gave her the treats, she vomited it out. Looks like its back to the less healthy alternative. I bought these for my cat and if I give them to him, hell eat them, but its not the type of treat hell do tricks for or run over to eat. Its a healthier alternative to other treats, but I wouldnt buy them again because my main point of buying treats is to train my cat to do tricks or reward him for good behavior. These treats simply dont entice him enough to really be a treat. This product is really a hit or miss. My cat does not seem to go crazy over these treats....Sometimes he does not eat these right away. I liked that these treats didnt have anything gross in them (i.e., corn, wheat, soy, by-products).  My cats dont really care for salmon, but i thought since it was mixed with turkey, which they love, they might like them. Well they didnt, they took one sniff and wanted nothing to do with them.  Though my inside cats didnt want them, the stray cats outside loved them. We have ordered Elecare from this shipper twice.  The first time, we received it next day and were very happy.  The second time, it arrived next day as well, but two of the cans had opened and the box got wet, causing the inside of the box to be covered in clumps of spoiled formula.  When we used one of the unopened cans (we had to since we had nothing else to feed the baby and this product is not sold in stores) the baby became sick for several days. As a fan of English & Irish breakfast teas, I found this tea to be very weak flavored.  If you like milder/weaker teas, this may be for you.  But if you like more robust flavors, steer clear of this one. This is a wonderful product...but it comes in a paper bag  which is easy to puncture and when you ship it in a box with no bubble wrap it slides around a lot and you start to get leakage of the product....powder everywhere.  I would order it again if I was sure it would be packaged right so it wouldnt be sliding around in the box. Great product and nice taste, glad they sell it online, not sure where to buy it in the local supermarket, it was a decent price, $2.11, I just thought that the shipping fee of $4.99 seemed high, but the product seems great! Purchased three pounds.  Arrived well packaged.  Am trying to find a replacement roaster of this blend.  This is good, but not great...well keep on looking. The coffee was not stale as some have had, but the roast is too dark for a bean such as this.  I believe a better product could be had with the same beans. We had found some other peaberry coffee previously which had a really interesting, rich flavor to us.  For some reason, this brand just tasted flat to us by comparison.  The search for the perfect peaberry coffee continues... Bought this product to give to a family member who lives cross country and is going thru treatment for cancer.  Lemongrass tea is supposed to help with side-effects of radiation and chemotherapy. I tried it as well.  Have had other products containing lemongrass tea that tasted better.  Still, good value for the price and could probably be mixed with other teas to improve taste. Its the standard Horizon milk, in small packages that you dont have to refrigerate.The only reason I buy this is I bake, and I hate being halfway through a recipe and discovering Im out of milk. With these packages, I throw it in the back of the cupboard, and its there when I need it. Obviously, I use fresh when I have it!I suppose the main market for this is kids lunches, where you dont want to worry about spoilage. It would be fine for that, although its about the most expensive way to buy milk (and the price of for this today is twice what I paid, and is currently twice that from other sellers on Amazon, so check around!)They also show reduced fat milk, but shipped me the low-fat. When I read the description of this it said mini - these are regular size.  Tastes great but my 86 year old mom wants the mini ones and I have not been able to find the smaller dine size ones. I WAS VERY EXCITED TO GET THIS THEN I HAD A CUP, I NEVER MADE IT THRU THE CUP...IT IS SO SWEET IT IS SICKENING REALLY, NOW I HAVE TO FIND FAMILY TO PAWN THIS STUFF ONTOAND CHRISTMAS IS A LONG WAY OFF...LOL The O ring for the top does not seal properly with the pitcher and you have to tilt the pitcher more than other pitchers to get adequate flow.  This makes the top fall off and the potential for all the contents to spill out.  I just lift the top up a little when I poor to bypass this problem.  The glass is sturdy and the apparatus that holds it is sturdy.  I got some stuff in between the metal ring and glass, which looked terrible, but is easily disassembled to clean.  There is no stop for the screw so over tightening during reassembly could break the glass. I really wanted this food to work, as it seems to have good ingredients for a decent price.  However, my cats, who are typically ravenous little mongrels, dont even bother to check it out when offered.  So much for saving a couple of bucks--now they eat Organix. This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.There! Now you know.My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and shes frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups shes tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. Shes tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A\">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>. With so many choices now, I thought I woudl give this a try.The Donut shop Decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short. I bought this because Amazon had DRASTICALLY increased the price on what I usually buy, so I thought Id try something new.  I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  Its called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, its a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that Ive started drinking the stronger varieties, its hard to go back to \"brown water.\") Very good tasteing product but I need to use it the smallist setting on my B-60 to really enjoy the depth. As a French Roast fan, I bought this brand of K-cup with high expectations, considering the name attached to it. I was disappointed. It has a hearty aroma and full-bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste.If youre a lover of the more robust roasts, I would recommend trying the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L41Y8A\">Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> instead. It is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick youre likely looking for. This flavored K-Cup isnt out of this world, but isnt horrible. In my opinion, its way more flavorful than the Wolfgang Puck Hazelnut K-Cup. We love flavored coffee in our house, and so I would go with this one again. Worth a try. I like strong, but smooth coffee. This coffee is strong enough, but a little on the bitter side for my taste. I have tasted other strong blends that I like much more. My husband, who likes a medium roast coffee, is OK with this coffee, but it not his favorite either. I would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe. Perhaps my expectations were too high. When I see the name \"Wolfgang Puck\", I expect to be impressed. This (to my taste) is very average tasting coffee. To be fair, it is billed as a medium roast, and thats what it is. However, its just too bland for my taste.If you want decaf with more character, try Green Mountain Coffees Dark Magic Decaf <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I2SK\">Green Mountain Coffee Decaf Dark Magic, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a>, or Emerils Jazzed Up Decaf <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004616B3Y\">Emerils Jazzed Up DECAF 48 K-Cups</a>. They are darker roasts though, so if you want a milder coffee the Wolfgang Puck might be what you are looking for. Well the creme caramel was on sale so I decided to give it a shot. Plus the fact that each K Cup is individually prepared by Mr. Puck himself. Anyway I quite enjoy these. I never buy flavored ones so overall Im happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as I usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild. The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didnt seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazons warehouse in the heat all summer.As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and Ive tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K-cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol This coffee is good and has nice subtle flavor. I am disappointed though because I looked at the bottom and it says decaf. I dunno bout you but I drink coffee for the caffeine. In the picture on bottom of box has text but it is so small I did not even consider looking on it. So just disappointed that is decaf and does not say on page when ordering. Good, but the Green Mountain reserve Sumatra is better by 1- 1 and a half stars. Sort of tastes a little stale. I love the names Wolfgang Puck gives to their coffees, but the coffee descriptions leave a lot to be desired.In this case, with \"Breakfast in Bed\", I expected a much more flavorful cup of coffee than delivered.  \"Breakfast in Bed\" is on the light side of the medium roasts and has a mild, but not very memorable flavor.  On the plus side, it is a smooth coffee and not acidic at all.A better choice, in my opinion, is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC\">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, which also comes in the 50 pack.ADDED: Another nice, smooth medium blend is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002APWQ0K\">Timothys World Coffee, Kona Blend for Keurig Brewers, Medium, 50-Count K-Cups</a>ADDED: for those who prefer a lighter smooth blend, try <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00196QVPM\">Keurig Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 80 K - Cup Colombian Fair Trade Slect Medium Roast Coffee</a> (link for product description only, not for best pricing). I love my Keurig coffee maker. And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM\">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. Its not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the small cup setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. Black, the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didnt add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isnt all that great. Sorry Wolfgang, but Im afraid this one is a yawner. I like dark strong coffee but I just didnt really care for this one.  Not sure what it really was, almost a tad bitter?  Unfortunately I have another whole box of 24 to use up.  I picked up some Sumatran Reserve (also a dark) and prefer it. If you like your flavored coffee to taste like coffee, this may not be for you.  I couldnt taste the coffee at all in the travel size brew, but the smaller brew sizes were a bit better. I got this coffee as part of a \"bold\" sampler pack.  While I found it flavorful I wouldnt call it bold.  My first WP k-cup was French Roast which I found extremely bitter.  This coffee doesnt have that problem.For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.My favorite k-cups are:Starbucks French RoastStarbucks Caffe VeronaStarbucks Pike Place RoastGreen Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran ReserveGreen Mountain Double Black DiamondGreen Mountain RevvGreen Mountain Dark MagicOther k-cups Ive tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold I love my Keurig but havent found my \"perfect\" cup of coffee yet, although this comes close. I prefer a medium brew, not bold or strong. Breakfast in Bed is my choice so far. Jamaica Me Crazy is a sweet, coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste.  It is not a bold blend, but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild.This is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die-hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends.  I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee, afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didnt linger.  For a flavored coffee, it isnt bad & if you are a coconut fan, it is a blend to try on for size. I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isnt bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because its not terrible. But I wouldnt buy this coffee again. If youre sensitive to after taste, I wouldnt recommend. Id Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee. I tried this coffee, even though it was significantly more expensive than the Green Mountain (organic, free trade) Sumatra that I have been using for some time. Wolfgang Puck has the name and the rep.If this were the only Sumatra dark roast on the market, Id be really happy with it. This is good coffee.It is not outstanding coffee. Compared to Folgers, this product is awesome. Unfortunately for Mr. Puck, I am comparing it to Green Mountain Sumatra.The organic and free trade Sumatra from Green Mountain is better to my taste, and it is cheaper. Mornings are good. The coffee is good,however the k-cup is not packaged well,the coffee machine barely streams coffee,more of a fast drip.  The whole idea is its fast,right? My hair dressers salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothys, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).Everyones taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. Wolfgang Puck was my second favorite. So far, I like Folgers the best.FOLGERS GOURMETSELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIANPrice per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROASTPrice per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burntand papery flavors.TIMOTHYS DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUMPrice per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.Ali Julia review The coffee is just OK, a little weak. The price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money. Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I dont know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale. Too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase. Its not bold or dark enough to stand up to the Keurigs 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking. More than a \"hint\" of coconut! Not very much vanilla. Being a vanilla fan and NOT a coconut fan - this is OK. This coffee is a lot like the Green Mountain Nantucket blend.  If you like that, youll like this.  Generally, the GM product costs less, but this was on sale. First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG\">Green Mountains Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesnt stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ\">Emerils Big Easy Bold</a>. Its a very nice coffee, though dont expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.Bottom line: You wont go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.

I really love this coffee, great tasting and bold.  However, on about 1/3rd of the pods, the foil separates from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup.  I can usually predict which ones will do it because the foil on the k-cup is not puffy like it has pressure, but flat and wrinkled. Its coconut flavored, either youll like it or not.  I was actually surprised since Im not a big fan of coconut, but I liked this coffee.  Not my favorite, but nice on occasion. This is less of a \"bold\" flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee. My wife is easy to please and shes not a fan. Ill finish the box but I reach of others first. The coffee is just OK. Its very mild, almost bordering on weak. Would buy it again if the price was right. Bought this on the recommendation of my son.  Not a big fan of flavored coffee, but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands.  How can you go wrong with Wolfgang Puck? The flavor of this coffee is good, it has a nice balance of Vanilla without being too strong.  Its not the boldest coffee, but its a nice afternoon treat.That being said, I have had problems with several pods.  When you hold them up to the light, you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod.  This causes a cup full of grounds when you brew the coffee, and also clogs up the pin at the bottom of the pod chamber.  Id say about 1 out of every 5 or 6 pods has this problem. I admit, I like my French Vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side.  This isnt.  Its a much stronger coffee brew, meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor.  On the other hand, its a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand (Van Houtte) isnt on sale or when its occasionally out of stock.  I like that it comes in a 2-pack because our family goes through a lot of k-cups and I dont have to order quite so often. I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.  Several of the pods burst during brewing.  I probably wont purchase this again. I was expecting a mellow caramel flavor, but this coffee is a bit sharp and you really cant make out any carmel flavor. I like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it wasnt strong enough. This one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor.  Ill be going back to Emerils Jazzd Up Decaf and trying the Coffee Peoples French Roast Decaf.  So far Ive loved everything by the coffee people except the organic blend.  If you like strong coffee dont buy this but if you like a weaker coffee that you can see through youd probably enjoy this one. I love this coffee!  I am not a strong coffee drinker and this coffee is perfect!  I have no problems with it working in my Cuisinart Keurig Brewer, I aways get the perfect tasting cup of coffee.I gave it 3 stars because one of the 2 packs contained only 13 K-Cups and not the 24 that it was supposed to have.The decaf 24-count (pack of 2) arrived with the correct amount of K-cups and is as yummy as the high test! We have tried just about every k-cup of regular coffee out there.  We dont do the flavor kind.  My husband loves the GM brand most of the coffees are mild (even when they say medium roast)...I go for a little more on the medium roast like the some of the Tullys and Caribou brands.  It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the \"Rodeo Drive\" or \"Breakfast in Bed\" k-cups which has no bitterness.  I must say though, we have now added the latter 2 flavors of Wolfgang to our buying ritual. My husband likes strong coffee.  I like medium.  Neither one of us like this particular one.  There just isnt much flavor of any kind...coffee or caramel.  We like the vanilla one much better.  Well drink this until its gone...but its the last flavor we choose, and its lasting way too long! The taste is fine, but the K-cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion, resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds!  I have never had this happen with any other brand of K-cup before and hope it is not the norm for Wolfgang Puck. I prefer the \"extra bold\" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  Its fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I wont be buying it again.  Id recommend the Timothys World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso instead. Taste is okay.  Not blown away.  Hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee.  Only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box.  Not what I want first thing in the morning. I had tried Green Mountain Sumatra Reserve and found it delicious and strong. Its not available on \"subscribe and save\" so I read the reviews and opted for Wolfgang Puck. My husband likes it and I like the flavour but its very weak in comparison to the Green Mountain. I have to order something else for me. We love Hazelnut coffee, but this just didnt have enough coffee flavor in it for me. Kind of on the weak side in my opinion. Ill keep looking. K-cups are marginally better than good coffee that I can buy at the store for 1/2 the price or less. This product was offered at $19.95 and I was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to $26.95. It is not really worth $19.95 and is certainly not worth any increase. Additionally, whats the deal on offering INSTANT COFFEE in K-cups for $15.99 leaving us to think its a good deal on REAL coffee. Do you want to lose our trust (business)???? Thats a good way to do it!!!!!!!!!!jb I ordered the vanilla coffee for my college age children.  Unfortunately, there were shipping delays and it did not arrive until the kids had returned to college for the Fall semester.  Update to come when they finally come home for a break -- it may be a while.  The other coffees I have ordered have all been tasty and a very good value, I have no reason to believe this will be any different. I can say that the k cups and the Keurig have been delightful.  I enjoy having a freshly brewed cup every time and like that I save a bunch of money by brewing at home into a travel mug rather than stopping to drop $2.00 for a cup on the way to work.  Saves all those styrofoam cups too! I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger. So here is another example of a 48-pack of k-cups I bought \"untested\".  I figured, well, I really enjoy Sumatras bold, smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver, so why not?  Wolfgang puck has a few restaurants, so maybe he knows coffee.So, this is utterly average in all departments.  Its not very bold or rich, although I can say it does have the bitterness, which is a bit unbalanced as it lacks the richness.  Purchased only because it appeared on the Subscribe & Save at a great price per k-cup.  That makes two WPs that have been run of the mill at best [Sumatra & French roast].  Next time Ill be more discerning. I really like to mix things up with k-cups and rarely buy 50-ct boxes of a single flavor.  Exception to the rule would be for dark, bold coffees such as French roasts, which I really enjoy.  So when Wolfgang Pucks French roast turned up on Amazons deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.Its fairly non-descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I dont hate or even dislike it, its okay, and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.Id call it mildly bold, average, and I wont be going out of my way to keep it on hand. First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger.

Its a very nice coffee, though dont expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.Bottom line: You wont go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees. Of all the K-Cup flavors that are out there, and there are many very good ones, this is one of my least favorites, and I have tried almost all of them.  Not much flavor to this one, even if you add various types of creamers.  Of course, it is all a matter of taste, but this one doesnt taste all that good.  It is not bad - it is just kind of there - like a generic coffee.  Try something else instead. The coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast.  I dont think I would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase. After receiving this coffee I made a few cups.  It was fairly smooth, not too overpowering, and had a slight mocha aroma.  Its OK coffee.  I likely will not purchase this one again because there are so many better ones.  To gauge my review for others, my favorites are Coffee People Donut Shop, Green Mountain Dark Magic, Coffee People Organic Bold, Emerils Big Easy Bold, and Tullys Kona Blend. I really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium. It is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees. This coffee is okay but certainly not as good as Green Mountains Breakfast Blend. It just doesnt taste as good. This is a great flavored coffee nevertheless, K-cups are getting too expensive for everyday home use.  I am now using the filler and using my own ground coffee much of the time. Its also helpful to look for other price alternatives. Disappointing... while folks like to say tofu has no flavor, I can discern  a type of neutrality and thisone is the blankest of blank slatesWet, watery, gelatinous, it is not a product i will buy again soon. I got it because shopping isa challenge.Its not awful, just disappointing. The benefits are the packaging and that is has shelf life. Eye Bought This Product On A Recommendation. However, Eye Cannot Seem To Get Past The Strange Taste Yet.  Eye Will Keep Using It To See If This Will Pass Or If Eye Will Acquire A Liking To It.  The Package States No Bitter Taste.  If It Is A Sweetener, Why Should There Be Any Bitter Taste? I bought duck rillettes from Amazon because my usual favorite duck rillette was not carried anymore by chefshop.com. I was expecting a really good rillette. Full flavored rillette. What I got was a rellette that lacked even flavor of duck and herbs/spices. The texture was good however. Tasted more like a pork rillette. I would not recommend Rouge Perigord Duck Rillettes. The product description says you are purchasing 6 boxes of 25 tea bags. I received only one box. I called amazon and they said that the quantity I received was correct and the description is wrong. They made it right, but shouldnt have had to. Beware!! As a spice mix fan, I make a point of trying multiple products on food - both fun and fattening in equal measure!  Ive also highlighted what I think are the standout mixes in Chef Toms line: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI\">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4\">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>.That said, this mix is a delicious treat, but it doesnt hold the attention of the taste buds like the standouts.  The primary notes are supposedly ancho chiles and smoked paprika, but overall the tastes are muddled and dont provide a zing to the dish.Its a very tasty addition on multiple items such as tri-tip and pot roast but not enough to justify the gourmet price.  It is also too heavy a mix to work well on chicken, fish, or to drizzle over a meat-pasta dish.Note: Surprisingly, the best pairings from Chef Tom for red meats are either the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5NKUK\">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Pork Rub</a> or a generous portion of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4\">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>. This is really a normal taste coffee. I would not buy more after I finish this one. In fact, I will still be sleepy after drinking two cups! The party I had you send this product to, is ENJOYING it immensley. He is unable to purchase this product in Arizona.Obviously, certain products are not available in his location and I was happy to help out. I want to thank you for your quick response in securing this request and I am sure he will look to order it in the future. Thank You...mario Not quiet what I was expecting.  The cherries were dried and could not taste the brandy.  The dark chocolate was good but too crunchy. I purchased this as a gamble, because there was NO product information listed, so I had no idea how much I was getting or exactly what was in it.  I was disappointed that the  \"large\" tin, was not all that large.  It was a round tin, approximately 4 inches tall, and maybe 7 or 8 inches across.  I was hoping that Large, especially for the price, would be one of the large and tall tins.  Its difficult to tell from the picture.  The product itself was good, but for the price, I was expecting more.  Id probably buy from them again. Honestly these cookies could have been better. I would buy them again if the shipping wasnt so ridiculous! I think it ended up being like 15 dollars for a few tiny cookies. What a ripoff. This decaf is OK.  It is a Medium Roast, not a dark roast (says it on the can, but not in the description here).  Also, unlike another reviewer, I think that it is ground very fine. Weve only used this once, but it kept us awake most of the night.  We were surprised because its decaf, but we couldnt sleep for hours after going to bed.  Tastes good, though. I was thinking of purchasing these Oakcakes.  However, in reading the ingredients, I dont see Oats listed. Are these Oakcakes without Oats?Wheat Flour, Vegetable Oils, Sugar, Wheat Bran, Invert Sugar Syrups, Salt, Skimmed Milk Powder, Raising Agent These steaks came out really good, but the bacon doesnt have much flavor and doesnt seem to add to the steaks.  The size of the steaks are perfect though and I would recommend it unless you are looking for a lot of bacon flavor. If your dog likes Naked bars then this is the same consistency. Its hard and sometimes my dog will eat it sometimetimes hell just leave it. Its quite hard. This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.There! Now you know.My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and shes frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups shes tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. Shes tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A\">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>. With so many choices now, I thought I woudl give this a try.The Donut shop Decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short. I bought this because Amazon had DRASTICALLY increased the price on what I usually buy, so I thought Id try something new.  I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  Its called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, its a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that Ive started drinking the stronger varieties, its hard to go back to \"brown water.\") Very good tasteing product but I need to use it the smallist setting on my B-60 to really enjoy the depth. As a French Roast fan, I bought this brand of K-cup with high expectations, considering the name attached to it. I was disappointed. It has a hearty aroma and full-bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste.If youre a lover of the more robust roasts, I would recommend trying the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L41Y8A\">Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> instead. It is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick youre likely looking for. This flavored K-Cup isnt out of this world, but isnt horrible. In my opinion, its way more flavorful than the Wolfgang Puck Hazelnut K-Cup. We love flavored coffee in our house, and so I would go with this one again. Worth a try. I like strong, but smooth coffee. This coffee is strong enough, but a little on the bitter side for my taste. I have tasted other strong blends that I like much more. My husband, who likes a medium roast coffee, is OK with this coffee, but it not his favorite either. I would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe. Perhaps my expectations were too high. When I see the name \"Wolfgang Puck\", I expect to be impressed. This (to my taste) is very average tasting coffee. To be fair, it is billed as a medium roast, and thats what it is. However, its just too bland for my taste.If you want decaf with more character, try Green Mountain Coffees Dark Magic Decaf <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I2SK\">Green Mountain Coffee Decaf Dark Magic, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a>, or Emerils Jazzed Up Decaf <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004616B3Y\">Emerils Jazzed Up DECAF 48 K-Cups</a>. They are darker roasts though, so if you want a milder coffee the Wolfgang Puck might be what you are looking for. Well the creme caramel was on sale so I decided to give it a shot. Plus the fact that each K Cup is individually prepared by Mr. Puck himself. Anyway I quite enjoy these. I never buy flavored ones so overall Im happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as I usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild. The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didnt seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazons warehouse in the heat all summer.As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and Ive tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K-cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol This coffee is good and has nice subtle flavor. I am disappointed though because I looked at the bottom and it says decaf. I dunno bout you but I drink coffee for the caffeine. In the picture on bottom of box has text but it is so small I did not even consider looking on it. So just disappointed that is decaf and does not say on page when ordering. Good, but the Green Mountain reserve Sumatra is better by 1- 1 and a half stars. Sort of tastes a little stale. I love the names Wolfgang Puck gives to their coffees, but the coffee descriptions leave a lot to be desired.In this case, with \"Breakfast in Bed\", I expected a much more flavorful cup of coffee than delivered.  \"Breakfast in Bed\" is on the light side of the medium roasts and has a mild, but not very memorable flavor.  On the plus side, it is a smooth coffee and not acidic at all.A better choice, in my opinion, is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC\">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, which also comes in the 50 pack.ADDED: Another nice, smooth medium blend is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002APWQ0K\">Timothys World Coffee, Kona Blend for Keurig Brewers, Medium, 50-Count K-Cups</a>ADDED: for those who prefer a lighter smooth blend, try <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00196QVPM\">Keurig Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 80 K - Cup Colombian Fair Trade Slect Medium Roast Coffee</a> (link for product description only, not for best pricing). I love my Keurig coffee maker. And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM\">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. Its not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the small cup setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. Black, the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didnt add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isnt all that great. Sorry Wolfgang, but Im afraid this one is a yawner. I like dark strong coffee but I just didnt really care for this one.  Not sure what it really was, almost a tad bitter?  Unfortunately I have another whole box of 24 to use up.  I picked up some Sumatran Reserve (also a dark) and prefer it. If you like your flavored coffee to taste like coffee, this may not be for you.  I couldnt taste the coffee at all in the travel size brew, but the smaller brew sizes were a bit better. I got this coffee as part of a \"bold\" sampler pack.  While I found it flavorful I wouldnt call it bold.  My first WP k-cup was French Roast which I found extremely bitter.  This coffee doesnt have that problem.For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.My favorite k-cups are:Starbucks French RoastStarbucks Caffe VeronaStarbucks Pike Place RoastGreen Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran ReserveGreen Mountain Double Black DiamondGreen Mountain RevvGreen Mountain Dark MagicOther k-cups Ive tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold I love my Keurig but havent found my \"perfect\" cup of coffee yet, although this comes close. I prefer a medium brew, not bold or strong. Breakfast in Bed is my choice so far. Jamaica Me Crazy is a sweet, coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste.  It is not a bold blend, but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild.This is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die-hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends.  I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee, afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didnt linger.  For a flavored coffee, it isnt bad & if you are a coconut fan, it is a blend to try on for size. I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isnt bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because its not terrible. But I wouldnt buy this coffee again. If youre sensitive to after taste, I wouldnt recommend. Id Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee. I tried this coffee, even though it was significantly more expensive than the Green Mountain (organic, free trade) Sumatra that I have been using for some time. Wolfgang Puck has the name and the rep.If this were the only Sumatra dark roast on the market, Id be really happy with it. This is good coffee.It is not outstanding coffee. Compared to Folgers, this product is awesome. Unfortunately for Mr. Puck, I am comparing it to Green Mountain Sumatra.The organic and free trade Sumatra from Green Mountain is better to my taste, and it is cheaper. Mornings are good. The coffee is good,however the k-cup is not packaged well,the coffee machine barely streams coffee,more of a fast drip.  The whole idea is its fast,right? My hair dressers salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothys, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).Everyones taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. Wolfgang Puck was my second favorite. So far, I like Folgers the best.FOLGERS GOURMETSELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIANPrice per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROASTPrice per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burntand papery flavors.TIMOTHYS DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUMPrice per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.Ali Julia review The coffee is just OK, a little weak. The price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money. Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I dont know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale. Too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase. Its not bold or dark enough to stand up to the Keurigs 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking. More than a \"hint\" of coconut! Not very much vanilla. Being a vanilla fan and NOT a coconut fan - this is OK. This coffee is a lot like the Green Mountain Nantucket blend.  If you like that, youll like this.  Generally, the GM product costs less, but this was on sale. First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG\">Green Mountains Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesnt stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ\">Emerils Big Easy Bold</a>. Its a very nice coffee, though dont expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.Bottom line: You wont go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.

Its a very nice coffee, though dont expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.Bottom line: You wont go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees. I really love this coffee, great tasting and bold.  However, on about 1/3rd of the pods, the foil separates from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup.  I can usually predict which ones will do it because the foil on the k-cup is not puffy like it has pressure, but flat and wrinkled. Its coconut flavored, either youll like it or not.  I was actually surprised since Im not a big fan of coconut, but I liked this coffee.  Not my favorite, but nice on occasion. This is less of a \"bold\" flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee. My wife is easy to please and shes not a fan. Ill finish the box but I reach of others first. The coffee is just OK. Its very mild, almost bordering on weak. Would buy it again if the price was right. Bought this on the recommendation of my son.  Not a big fan of flavored coffee, but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands.  How can you go wrong with Wolfgang Puck? The flavor of this coffee is good, it has a nice balance of Vanilla without being too strong.  Its not the boldest coffee, but its a nice afternoon treat.That being said, I have had problems with several pods.  When you hold them up to the light, you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod.  This causes a cup full of grounds when you brew the coffee, and also clogs up the pin at the bottom of the pod chamber.  Id say about 1 out of every 5 or 6 pods has this problem. I admit, I like my French Vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side.  This isnt.  Its a much stronger coffee brew, meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor.  On the other hand, its a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand (Van Houtte) isnt on sale or when its occasionally out of stock.  I like that it comes in a 2-pack because our family goes through a lot of k-cups and I dont have to order quite so often. I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.  Several of the pods burst during brewing.  I probably wont purchase this again. I was expecting a mellow caramel flavor, but this coffee is a bit sharp and you really cant make out any carmel flavor. I like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it wasnt strong enough. This one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor.  Ill be going back to Emerils Jazzd Up Decaf and trying the Coffee Peoples French Roast Decaf.  So far Ive loved everything by the coffee people except the organic blend.  If you like strong coffee dont buy this but if you like a weaker coffee that you can see through youd probably enjoy this one. I love this coffee!  I am not a strong coffee drinker and this coffee is perfect!  I have no problems with it working in my Cuisinart Keurig Brewer, I aways get the perfect tasting cup of coffee.I gave it 3 stars because one of the 2 packs contained only 13 K-Cups and not the 24 that it was supposed to have.The decaf 24-count (pack of 2) arrived with the correct amount of K-cups and is as yummy as the high test! We have tried just about every k-cup of regular coffee out there.  We dont do the flavor kind.  My husband loves the GM brand most of the coffees are mild (even when they say medium roast)...I go for a little more on the medium roast like the some of the Tullys and Caribou brands.  It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the \"Rodeo Drive\" or \"Breakfast in Bed\" k-cups which has no bitterness.  I must say though, we have now added the latter 2 flavors of Wolfgang to our buying ritual. My husband likes strong coffee.  I like medium.  Neither one of us like this particular one.  There just isnt much flavor of any kind...coffee or caramel.  We like the vanilla one much better.  Well drink this until its gone...but its the last flavor we choose, and its lasting way too long! The taste is fine, but the K-cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion, resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds!  I have never had this happen with any other brand of K-cup before and hope it is not the norm for Wolfgang Puck. I prefer the \"extra bold\" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  Its fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I wont be buying it again.  Id recommend the Timothys World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso instead. Taste is okay.  Not blown away.  Hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee.  Only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box.  Not what I want first thing in the morning. I had tried Green Mountain Sumatra Reserve and found it delicious and strong. Its not available on \"subscribe and save\" so I read the reviews and opted for Wolfgang Puck. My husband likes it and I like the flavour but its very weak in comparison to the Green Mountain. I have to order something else for me. We love Hazelnut coffee, but this just didnt have enough coffee flavor in it for me. Kind of on the weak side in my opinion. Ill keep looking. K-cups are marginally better than good coffee that I can buy at the store for 1/2 the price or less. This product was offered at $19.95 and I was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to $26.95. It is not really worth $19.95 and is certainly not worth any increase. Additionally, whats the deal on offering INSTANT COFFEE in K-cups for $15.99 leaving us to think its a good deal on REAL coffee. Do you want to lose our trust (business)???? Thats a good way to do it!!!!!!!!!!jb I ordered the vanilla coffee for my college age children.  Unfortunately, there were shipping delays and it did not arrive until the kids had returned to college for the Fall semester.  Update to come when they finally come home for a break -- it may be a while.  The other coffees I have ordered have all been tasty and a very good value, I have no reason to believe this will be any different. I can say that the k cups and the Keurig have been delightful.  I enjoy having a freshly brewed cup every time and like that I save a bunch of money by brewing at home into a travel mug rather than stopping to drop $2.00 for a cup on the way to work.  Saves all those styrofoam cups too! I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger. So here is another example of a 48-pack of k-cups I bought \"untested\".  I figured, well, I really enjoy Sumatras bold, smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver, so why not?  Wolfgang puck has a few restaurants, so maybe he knows coffee.So, this is utterly average in all departments.  Its not very bold or rich, although I can say it does have the bitterness, which is a bit unbalanced as it lacks the richness.  Purchased only because it appeared on the Subscribe & Save at a great price per k-cup.  That makes two WPs that have been run of the mill at best [Sumatra & French roast].  Next time Ill be more discerning. I really like to mix things up with k-cups and rarely buy 50-ct boxes of a single flavor.  Exception to the rule would be for dark, bold coffees such as French roasts, which I really enjoy.  So when Wolfgang Pucks French roast turned up on Amazons deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.Its fairly non-descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I dont hate or even dislike it, its okay, and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.Id call it mildly bold, average, and I wont be going out of my way to keep it on hand. First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger.

Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ\">Emerils Big Easy Bold</a>. Its a very nice coffee, though dont expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.Bottom line: You wont go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees. Of all the K-Cup flavors that are out there, and there are many very good ones, this is one of my least favorites, and I have tried almost all of them.  Not much flavor to this one, even if you add various types of creamers.  Of course, it is all a matter of taste, but this one doesnt taste all that good.  It is not bad - it is just kind of there - like a generic coffee.  Try something else instead. The coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast.  I dont think I would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase. After receiving this coffee I made a few cups.  It was fairly smooth, not too overpowering, and had a slight mocha aroma.  Its OK coffee.  I likely will not purchase this one again because there are so many better ones.  To gauge my review for others, my favorites are Coffee People Donut Shop, Green Mountain Dark Magic, Coffee People Organic Bold, Emerils Big Easy Bold, and Tullys Kona Blend. I really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium. It is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees. This coffee is okay but certainly not as good as Green Mountains Breakfast Blend. It just doesnt taste as good. This is a great flavored coffee nevertheless, K-cups are getting too expensive for everyday home use.  I am now using the filler and using my own ground coffee much of the time. Its also helpful to look for other price alternatives. I like the Senseo coffee machine and believe that it can make very good coffee. However, I have been disappointed with the Senseo coffee pods that are made in Belgium by Douwe Egberts. The pods are not individually wrapped and the coffee often does not taste fresh. The pods also contain too little coffee which results in a weak, watery brew. The flavored Senseo French Vanilla Caramel Bistro Coffee Pods seem to me to be better than most Senseo blends that I have tried. In general, I prefer to buy pods from Timothys World Coffee. The Timothy pods contain almost twice as much coffee as the Senseo pods and the resulting coffee is superior, in my view. I have found that the Timothy pods will work well in the Senseo machine if the pod is moistened and smoothed before latching the lid. I use the single pod holder and make a 4 ounce cup. If you must use the Senseo pods made by Douwe Egberts, try this blend. there is not much one can say about Hawaiian punch.  my kids love it.  the only r eason i took off 2 stars is that i ordered 8 64 oz bottles and received 4 128 oz bottles.  i need the smaller bottles so my kids can pour on their own.  i will have to revert to going to the supermarket for future Hawaiian  punch needs. I love the coconut water - light and refreshing, packed with potassium. I was guzzling it down like, well, water, daily. I dont really enjoy plain water a lot of the time, but this provided refreshment, hydration, and flavor without a lot of the junk and/or calories that other drinks come with. 5 stars.I was looking forward to continuing buying it and consuming it regularly with subscribe and save. However....Price, specifically change in price, is terrible. 1 star. I cannot say more. Every time I heated this particular soup in any microwave, the container made a popping sound and popped up off the turning tray, fell over, and spilled out. If you can catch it before it spills over completely, you will find when eating that the noodles all gravitate to the bottom and you are left with a very untasty, pasty noodle mash at the end of the serving. Love this stuff, very easy to work with and reasonably priced if you can manage to buy it through Amazon with thier subscribe and save program, otherwise it is pretty expensive and you are better off making your own MMF. The Wilton stuff is like rubber and hard to roll out thin enough. I had no trouble with this. It also was not too sticky which was the problem I ran into when I used the Duff product from Michaels. So far this is the best fondant I have used. It really doesnt dry out so if you want your pieces to stiffen up quickly or become completely hard you will need to mix in gumtex, tylose or gumpaste to accomplish that. I love the taste of this fondant too, I dont usually like fondant icings but this one is really good! The white is truely white too, not cream or antique at all so you can easily mix in other colors to tint the color you want.UPDATE 1/6/12Lowering my stars from 5 to 3...My first few batches of Fondarific were great, easy to work with, good taste, nice consistency etc. I use alot of fondant and have pretty much used every brand out there plus made my own. I was totally sold on Fondarific until my last couple of orders. I didnt feel like dying fondant so I purchased the colored Fondarific for the first time(Pink and Red) so Im not sure if that was the problem but they were REALLY soft. Like another reviewer I ended spending an extra 3 hours or so to cover my cake and decorate it because I had to keep putting the stuff in the freezer and it tore and bubbled all over the place. It was ridiculous like working with melting taffy. I live in Washington state and it was October so humidity was definitely not the problem. My last batch of white was workable but also stickier than usual so pieces kept sticking to the mat (even with cornstarch or shortening). So far both batches of black that I purchased were great and didnt have these issues. I have to agree with other reviewers here that the consistancy is lacking with this product. If you get a good batch it is the BEST stuff out there but you have to cross your fingers and hope luck is with you. I may give them one more shot since my first few orders of white were perfect but I will probably also make some marshmellow fondant just in case they arent up to snuff. This product worked well for small cakes.  It also tasted great.  For any cakes over 12 inches, it just would pull until their was a hole in it.  It is almost too soft a product. I did a lot of research on this fondant and really wanted to like it however it just didnt work for me. When it arrived it was hard as a rock, but there is a card inside that indicates about 30-50 seconds in the microwave will make it easier to work with. This really did work well. It made it much more pliable and easier to work with. The fondant took color real well and rolled out nicely. It does say \"no shortening or powdered sugar needed\" thats pretty false. If youre coloring it you do need some while needing otherwise it will stick to your hands and your work surface. I DEFINITELY needed powdered sugar while rolling it out. Otherwise it stuck to the silicon mat I use. Also, after coloring and putting it in the microwave it definitely needed some time in the refrigerator before it could be rolled again and placed on the cake. Otherwise it was far too gooey.Finally, the moment of truth arrived, laying the rolled out fondant on the cake. It was much more difficult to work with than I imagined. Its very picky on the thickness. Too thick its impossible to lay flat, too thin and it would stretch and get holes. I will say it did get some elephant skin during application I was able to smooth it out using a smoothing tool and the final product looked fine. Perhaps I was a little bit rusty, I used to teach a Wilton cake decorating class and have taught fondant decorating for many years but havent done a cake in the past 5-6 years. I just never remember the wilton brand, which tastes horrible, ever being this hard to work with.The flavor was fine on its own, but as most fondants, its incredibly sweet..incredibly. Despite the improved flavor people were still pealing it off the cake and eating the cake and frosting.In the end the cake looked wonderful and people were pleased but not sure Ill be using this brand again. I have ordered many tubs of fondarific in many colors, and generally dont have many problems. If you are looking for a fondant to sculpt figurines out of, this is not the fondant for you. It is, however, the best tasting fondant you will find, guaranteed. It does not dry out which is lovely for covering cakes, but is the reason sculpting is impossible.This last time I ordered a five pound bucket in wedding white, it was horrible. It was so soft it was almost gooey. I had my AC at 65 degrees, placed it in the freezer for awhile, and it was still stretchy and soft as if I had been kneading it forever. I even added some gumpaste and a ton of tylose to try to stiffen it a little, to no avail.I was in a bind and had no time to get or make more fondant, so my cake took 3 times as long as it would have, and it looked horrible. I was very disappointed.I guess I just got a bad batch this time. I would suggest that you order ahead of time and check it first so you dont get stuck like I did. I wanted to try this coffee once in my life. I was very happy with the company that mailed it, and the timely manner in which they sent it. havent used it yet , but if going by past Marshal Creek products ... ? should be good. The blend of ingredients is great and a good balance of dried fruit and nuts that our family enjoys. I was having trouble finding it in the local stores that I shop so I thought I would shop for this online. I was happy to find it but unhappy about how much more it costs to order online than picking it up at a local store. I dont think I will order it again online and will simply keep my eyes open when I shop locally. After reading reviews and testing these out with friends, I can say this: Everyones tastes (and tastebuds) are different. What is not sweet to one person is super sweet to another. So be ye warned, results for these may vary.I found that the tablets didnt make things \"sweet\" as much it cut down on the sourness, almost like a numbing effect.  Ever put sugar on a lemon slice and bit into it? The sour kick is still there, just canceled out. Im certainly not going to be eating them like candy as some reviews suggest.Tried out a few beer types, with mixed results: Beers that are fruity/citrus ended up gross, as it would taste like I mixed in a mouthful of juice with the beer. Dark beers like an Irish Red were my favorite.I really recommend going out to eat so you can try a variety of things. Certain foods will take you for surprise (ranch dressing, for example, was notably different and very good). These tablets did work, but were not nearly as effective as I had expected.  I set up an entire spread of foods, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, liquids etc to try and when my friends and I allowed the tablets to dissolve, they only worked on a couple things and only for a very short period of time (maybe 5-10 min?) They do make sour stuff sweet for a bit, but sometimes it gives it an odd flavor... great novelty item. This tablet which is referred to as the miracle berry is used to distort taste of unpleasant(to you) items. You can let 1 dissolve in your mouth,swishing around once or twice, then bite a lemon and it taste sweet. It is an odd sort of sweet. It comes with a list of items you can use it with, lemons,strawberries,cheese. I was using it to try and mask the taste of the salt water flush while doing the master cleanse. It DOES NOT mask salt water. Not sure of a use Id have for it. It does what it claims, just not needed for me. I tasted about half of the different foods on the big list of recommendations. Most tasted slightly different. Some got a sweet tickling in the mouth. I got the strongest effects from vinegar, ketchup/mustard and Salt-vinegar chips. But nothing tasted miraculously better as I had expected. As others have pointed out, everyone reacts differently. The two other people I did it with seemed to have about my reaction as well. One experienced a bit stronger and the other one a bit weaker than me. You could try this if you are interested but I wouldnt buy it again. I bought these tablets to try during lunch at work. Four of us each tried one tablet, tasted various foods, and noticed no difference. At that point, I gave up, but two intrepid friends went on to try four tablets each. They reported strange flavors in some of the foods they tried, but many items remained unaffected. Among those that were was a fruit punch Powerade reported to taste so sweet as to be very repulsive (like drinking pure sugar), and a cashew which apparently tasted like heaven. Most other affected foods were impacted negatively.In all, we were unimpressed with these tablets. While they did accomplish their flavor-changing purpose, it took a lot of tablets before any change was noticeable. And the experience, though fun, was rather pricey considering how many tablets were required. I was really hoping for a bigger impact. I was a little dissapointed. It tastes  good. It is just a little watery tasting. Land of the lakes is better. But they dont have sugar free. So for sugar free I can give a heads up on this product. So I am a huge Chocolate Peanut Butter freak, and have been looking for a peanut butter cup cocoa for a while. I finally broke down and ordered this after a few months hemming and hawwing about it. Now I aadmit to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water(I was at work and had little choice) The next day I deceided to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a GREAT improvement!! So as a result Im going to try an experiment tonight and make a shake in the blender with the mix!!! I said im a peanut butter cup freak!!! This is an OK hot cocoa. I had been using Land OLakes product, but wanted to try this for a change. The taste is comparable, but the portions in each packet is smaller. I still like Land OLakes hot cocoa better. I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured Id give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so Ill give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephens and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.vsNestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2gNestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1gI first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldnt finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and Im happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and its ok.  I cant rave about it due to the fact that its higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.To me dark chocolate shouldnt be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, Im sure thats why I prefer dark chocolate.  Ill even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.But as Ive said its all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.Not bad, just not all that great if you dont like REALLY sweet hot chocolate. This product contains partially hydrogenated oils which is very detrimental to your health. I would rather pay more for a product which does not contain transfats. Ended up with a case of the Stephens chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephens French Vanilla\"cocoa.\"  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believewhat you read, right?I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed justwatery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale forthe same amount of servings?Granted, Amazons price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping throughhere and shipping is at a premium through Stephens Gourmet.I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you dont like it.sighgive it away~ This review is for their dark chocolate. Most who like dark chocolate are into the pure chocolate taste and its health effects...not the sweetness! Just as with good coffee, its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there arent that many sweet-freak-fatties drinking it. The ancient Incas didnt use any sugar at all with their chocolate!I did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their arent many companies that even make one, so kudos to them for that. I was really disappointed in this coffee.  Its a darker roast than i was expecting and the bag has no expiration date.  My coffee tasted quite stale and old. The Jeremiahs 5lb bag of Ethiopian coffee is often sold-out, so Ive been looking for a good roast with similar value. Im OK with a more medium roast, but this coffee seems more mild then I would have expected. Still a good deal, but I wish it had more flavor. In general, Ive had good luck with Jeremiahs brand, although sometimes the bags are not as well-sealed as they should be. Delivery of the product was quick, however the items are smaller than how they appear on line. Next time I would order the larger size. An otherwise good gum reduced to a three-star review by really mind-boggling packaging. I fail to see the advantage of the foil-covered capsule approach. I lose approximately one piece a pack by pressing just the wrong way and having the gum shoot out of the package like a cannon, forever lost.The gum itself is decent, lasts for slightly less than a twenty five minute car drive, packs a comfortable punch, and improves breath. Still, its not outstanding, and doesnt overcome the poor packaging, so wont be buying any more. Cant say much about the product itself.  was a gift for friends in California who had just given birth and it arrived 5-6 days after shipping totally melted.  The seller gave early warning before shipping stating the weather had been abnormally hot and that they could not be held responsible for packages missed and left to sit in the heat.  I assumed that was not an issue considering my wife was at their home and aware the package would be arriving and I had also purchased priority shipping (additional $8+dollars).  No such luck.  Be sure whoever you are buying these from gives you absolute specifics before you buy.Just to be fair, I have to say the seller was very quick and courteous with responses to my concerns.  Unfortunately she didnt even consider any form of compensation though.  I really hate throwing money away and giving a less than memorable gift at the same time. My cats all love this product just like they love the other flavors. I dare not run out of these treats or I might have a kitty uprising! This simple yet tasteless product did what it said it would, thicken gravy and soups. This product in my opinion should be used in the morning before work or people who are studing late nights as Chia makes you energized. I bought these to put in smoothies and they do not totally grind up in the blender.  I am going to try to grind them by hand before i add to the blender. It all depends on your texture preference.  I do not mind seeds from fruits but these bugged me! This is a pleasant tea, it tastes mostly of chamomile.  Unfortunately for me, it doesnt do too much to squelch heartburn.  Im now 36 weeks along and have had heartburn almost the whole time, and I was hoping this would help out but it really hasnt had an effect. I do like the tea just as a mild beverage, but I cant recommend it for pregnancy related heartburn. Got this as a gift for the office.  Its nice to get people to take a break from work to see what they get.  Unfortunately, its not well mixed.  Its almost gone and so far, all the black ones are not the licorice (and that is the good flavor compared to the other one, ick!), same goes to the white ones and the there was only one pair of the blue to be played :( Taste is just Ok, a bit greasy compare to 94% fat free micro kettle pop corn bags (purchases here at better cost.) Coconut flavor is like coconut flakes flavoring.Not a good value since you get 18 bags for $30. Purchased it because I wondered about it since I love Coconut.Wont buy again because of the greasy feeling and high cost. Gave it to my daughter who uses it in recipes but I wanted to use it in smoothies.  It tasted to bad to me. I love my coffee, and because of that, I have tried lots and lots of varieties although I began as a simple Folgers fantatic.  Jamaican Mountain Blue Coffee has been touted to be the best of the best world coffees out there by such highly esteemed sources as the Food Network and the kitchens of the White House.I found the low acidity of the coffee very refreshing, but the darkness of this roast has not allowed a lot of subtleness of the flavor to come out.  To me, this tastes like Folgers at its best, but nothing more than that.  Great for everyday drinking, because it is smooth and rich and leaves little acid \"bite.\"  But still, after having tried Kona coffee with its myriad of subtle flavors, I found Blue Mountain kinda boring.I guess I disagree with experts, but hey, my coffee is important and taste is everything!  If you like exotic flavors, this isnt it.  But it you would like to have consistently smooth, rich, honest coffee, this is the one. I am a coffee lover of many years and as such am always interested in finding good coffees.  This was my first time to try blue mountain, and purchasing it with a gift certificate allowed me to be a bit more extravagant than I otherwise would have been.While the coffee is good, I dont find it to be superior to other coffees I have ordered which are considerably less expensive. I bought this coffee in Jamaica ($15 for 1 lb bag).  While I liked and enjoyed it, I prefer several coffees from my local shops at about the same price.  I think that it may have been worth the $15/lb, but no more.  Certainly not at these prices. Went to Jamaica last May and brought about 6 pounds of this and the Waldenfords Blue Mtn back with me. About half what you are paying here, but still not worth the money. It is good coffee. No question. But dont believe all the hype. I am a casual coffee drinker and someone that takes coffee more seriously might get more benefit from this coffee. To me, not the case. I order my Peets Arabian Mocha Java online for about $14/lb and it is still my favorite coffee. We own a small neighborhood bar and the patrons enjoy having the novelty of fresh, hot pork rinds served to them with their beverages. It was quite a commitment for me to buy this quantity of pork rinds from Amazon but I decided that I would \"give it a go\" since I like the pork rinds that are sold in grocery stores and I figured that these could only be better since theyd be fresher when microwaved.  They taste great and I think that they have the perfect amout of spice.  HOWEVER, two things....the smell is \"funky\" when they come out of the microwave.  Regardless of the taste, I cant seem to get used to the smell.  Secondly, when it comes to popcorn, I have to pop popcorn less than the directions on the package in my microwave or it will burn.  I found it to be the opposite with these pork rinds.  I had to cook the port rinds LONGER than the directions say on the package, otherwise they wouldnt be popped nicely and were a bit chewy.  So if you find that you cook these and they dont seem crispy enough, cook them in your microwave longer than the directions say to do so. I was so excited to see these! And the price is good.First, it takes a little learning to figure out how to cook these. The instructions are not much help. \"Stop cooking when the bag stops expanding\"....they might as well say, perform a Vulcan mind meld with the pork rinds to know when they are done. I found that the bags expansion--or not---has little to do with whether they are done. I have a 1200 watt microwave and 1:30 was perfect. 1:00 and they were not cooked, 2:00 and I had charcoal bits.I had to sacrifice a couple of precious bags to figure this out.Taste and texture? Well they are infinitely better than bags of pork rinds from the store. The texture is very good. The taste? I am in no way shy of salty food, love me some salt! But these were borderline too much for me. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and Ideal on them to make them sweet and I still had a hard time eating them. My husband liked them this way though.If they could back off the strong salty flavor, I would buy these again. As it is, Im going to use them to make low-carb nachos. I wont be reordering them though. Love the crispy texture! But cant choke down the overpowering saltiness. taste is not like other pork rinds.  but does not taste bad.  when you microwave them, the bag only pops up about half way.  when its done popping and you eat them immediately, they are pretty hot and seem to melt in your mouth.  needing much water and a brushing to get the rinds and the taste out of your mouth afterwards.  I think the idea is pretty good, but the product did not turn out how they expected in my opinion. These are an okay snack. They dont puff up like the Pork Rinds I have had in the past. The quantity of rinds in the bag seems lacking. There is a unusual taste as if some type of seasoning added that I cant figure out. If you want a salty snack with no carbs they are okay, I, however, will not buy them again. Ill stick with the regular puffed up ones or cracklings. These dont fit in either category quite the way I expected. I did not find the smell to be anything but inviting.  Warm pork rinds is a concept that was new to me.  I found the taste to be very good.  I had no problems with the cook time and the bag did not collapse on the product.  My only complaint is that there was just too much salt. Takes at least three minutes in my Micro, and some are singed while some are still old maids. Good flavor but just a little salty for me. I do not recommend. Ive been low-carb dieting and I like pork rinds so I couldnt wait to try these. Theyre not really \"spicy\", theyre more like mild in my opinion. They are good, they taste just like the pork rinds that you buy at the store, not \"bacon-y\" at all to me. The only downside is that your house will smell like hot pork rinds. Its pretty bad, I dont normally notice things like that but its pretty smelly and hard to get rid of. I bought this out of curiosity after seeing it on the Food Network.  It does taste good.  You do have to carefully follow the directions on the bag.  This doesnt work the same as microwave popcorn.  The \"bake\" time is quite short, and overcooked pork rinds arent pretty or tasty.  I think that in the future, if I want warm pork rinds, Ill try warming up a small batch of my usual brand in the toaster oven for a couple of minutes. I like the taste of these but they are inconsistent in texture (some are really really hard, while others are what you would expect).  You have to be careful with the microwaving part, but even when you are, its hard to get consistent results. They also could be a little spicier for my taste. On July 26, 2012 I ordered Lowreys Hot and Spicy Pork Rinds. I received the Orginal Pork Rinds. I am not happy with this product. I will keep them as they will be to expensive to send them back. I feel you should have checked my previous orders I had ordered, or at least contacted me about my order. Thank you, Colleen Avey I bought these on another online site and the Amazon ones are almost $3 cheaper. I love these. In fact, Ive grown quite addicted. Unfortunatley, they have tons of sodium and also contain MSG, which is causing me to gain a lb or two of water weight and stalls my weight loss progress very effectively. If I were only trying to maintain, these wouldnt be a problem.I wont buy them again, for these reasons. THE PRODUCT, BEING NEW, IS FAIR, BUT HAVE NOT HAD TOO MUCH LUCK GETTING IT TO EXPAND MUCH....HAVE TOOOOOOO MANY FLAT HARD PIECES....FLAVOR IS OKAY, BUT HAS A GREASY TASTE TO START, LIKE ITS BEEN SITTING IN BACON GREASE..I HAVE TRUST THAT IN TIME THE PRODUCT WILL IMPROVE AS ALL NEW PRODUCTS DO, ....I THINK IT IS A GOOD CONCEPT AND HOPE IT DOES GET BETTER These taste just like any other packaged pork rind product Ive tried. I was hoping these would be fresher, closer to the real thing I buy in Mexican markets. Oh well, for a quick snack when you dont feel like leaving the house, its fine. I have popped several of these bags in the past week, And every single one of them does not pop up as much as they used to. They used to pop up like a bag of popcorn does, These bags stay very flat in the microwave oven, And when you take the bag out you have to be very quick about opening it, Or it implodes and sticks together!I used to purchase these Microwave Pork Rinds direct from the company, And had never had a problem until now.So its up to you to decide if you want to buy these or not, They are very tasty and very healthy for you too! I had trouble finding just the right amount of time to microwave Lowreys Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds and now that I have theyre okay, but I doubt I will buy them again...I ruined quite a few in the process. This chili is filling and mildly spicy. Cooks well, however it makes exploding noises in my microwave. Keep box of saltines nearby and nuke this stuff and its about the best lunch out of a microwave that I have ever had in my 45 years of working.Nice and thick, no weird burnt spices, mystery meat, but they all have that.I will buy this again. One of the disappointments with Campbells Chunky Chili is that the \"meat\" is chewy and doesnt really taste like meat. Overall, the chili is acceptable as a quick lunch alternative but dont expect anything resembling homemade chili. Campbells makes some great soups,but their chili on the other hand,leaves alot to be desired,its tastes okay,just not up to snuff,I prefer Hormel(w/ or w/out beans) or even better HOMEADE!!!(and I make a mean chili,no compalints yet!!!) Taste is not bad and there is plenty of beans and beef.Too much sodium. If you have high blood pressure, this product is a no, no. Not as good as the reviews led me to expect. Despite great color and good viscosity, the syrups flavor lacked intensity.  Ill continue my quest elsewhere. The coffee is overall OK.  I had to make it strong for it to taste good. When made weak it wasnt very good. My spouse didnt like it however I made it (personal taste). I used whole beans in a Breville YouBrew grinder/coffee maker. Im glad that I tried it as Kona blend is suppose to be very good. Three stars! I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  Im not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3. The coffee was send quickly. It was satisfactory but not as good as other Mocha Java coffees Ive tasted (perhaps because I now have to stick to decafe). The company sent a sample of decafe Costa Rican coffee which was very good. I really like this granola - their hemp granola is my favorite. REALLY good stuff. However - its just too sweet for my taste. Most granola is dreadfully sugar-laden, and other than the healthy ingredients, I feel like Im chomping on some commercial-grade grocery store sugar cereal... -___-That said, the texture is very satisfying and it is tasty. Just a bit sweet. Youve been warned.. ;) I usually order this item from Amazon since our local grocery stores (Walmart and Safeway) do not carry it, but. . .I would expect that buying in bulk would be cheaper, but instead, six bags of 26.4 ounces is eight cents PER OUNCE more expensive than buying six boxes of 11.5 ounces.  Shouldnt it be the other way around? This is not a savings at all. the meat has some flavor i feel it could have a little more and also the slices are very thin so they burn quick if you dont pay attention. the cucumber sause from the same place is amazing though! I have been researching the web to find some gyro strips and this is the most expensive so far, maybe look elsewhere? 3 months later and I STILL HAVE 1 more box, after giving away the other TWO boxes lol. Theres no taste in butter and although its a reasonable price, Its too simple, no flavor and you can sometimes get burned popcorn even though the same timing worked for the same PACKAGE and the same MICROWAVE (so never leave your popcorn unattended)! This would be a great soup if Health Valley  lowered the sugar content at least in half or more. The company took the Health out of the Valley with this soup.When one buys a No Salt soup they are doing so for Health Reasons, if one is watching their salt  intake they are  also in most cases concerned about their sugar intake .I buy health Valley No Salt Soups because  they are Organic , No or little salt  and yes low in sugar, 14 grams of Sugar is shameful.They do a good job with their No Salt Soups except with their Tomato Soup. Fix it Health Valley . Use carrots as a sweetener?? Give it some thought??? Have generally enjoyed this product over a few years-but found that one container (of 6-1 lb. size that I was shipped) so far had quite inferior ghee-with the milk fat still present-made me a bit sick-and threw away rest of container. The good news:  Very easy to make, tasty good noodles, a few veggiesThe bad news: 1130 mg of sodium (about half your daily allowance) -- Yikes!Notes: 290 calories, 0 mg Cholesterol, 2g fiber, 2g sugar, 7g protein, 11g fat (6g saturated fat)These noodles are tasty, the broth is OK, there are a few veggies sprinkled on top.  Pour in boiling water wait 3 minutes (or longer) and youre done.  A good, quick, hot lunch when youre in a hurry.  But dont eat too often as the sodium content is incredibly high and would not be good for you.  OK once in awhile, though, unless youre on a sodium restricted diet, in which case, why are you even reading this far? ;)Tip:  You can probably reduce the sodium content by pouring off the liquid after preparing and eating just the noodles and veggies.  Or add your own healthier liquid broth, even, if you wish.Also, you can let this sit for 6-8 minutes of even longer and it will be good and still very hot. I would have liked to give these 2 and a half stars, because theyre basically middle-of-the-road. They taste more or less like a Fig Newton, and you wont miss the fat at all. They are not as soft as Fig Newtons.These cookies are great if youre on a diet because two of them are only 100 calories, however they are on the small side so you may end up eating more.I would say that overall, the taste is comparable to a Fig Newton, but slightly more firm in texture and a smaller size. With all things considered, if a box of Fig Newtons and Fig Newmans were sitting on the shelf together, I would probably just go by price and get the cheaper item and not think about the brand. Although I loved the ease and price of making this purchase online, when it arrived over half of the cans were very severely dented.  A few so much so that it was almost impossible to order them.I definitely have to reconsider where I purchase this in the future. I love this product and order it frequently.  Usually it arrives in a timely manner and in good condition.  When I opened this last shipment I found some hemp seed scattered throughout the box.  I carefully removed the first of two pouches and found a 1\" rip in the middle of the front of the bag.  Most of the product was still in the pouch and appeared fresh and undamaged so I transferred it to a container.  The other pouch was intact.  I hope this is a one-time occurrence, and I will be ordering this again when I need more.  More care needs to be taken to assure that the pouches are handled properly and that they are all in good condition when packed. these are great tasting candies for a sugar-free variety, but they get sticky and very hard to take out of the individual wrappers, especially without getting the candy all over your fingers. Oddly, I have given the cats Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size and they seemed to like it. I bought 2 cases of this 3oz and they only touch it after realizing that I will not give them more food.It may be because I gave them Turkey & Seafood for a while in between. Its odd because they scarf up that flavor, and they would scarf up the Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size. WEIRD.I rate it 5 stars for the ingredients and quality. I always feed them Castor & Pollux. However, as always, test not only the flavor but also the size of the can. When I scoop the food out of the can the consistency in the 3oz cans seems somewhat thicker than the 5.5oz (in all flavors I have tried). This may be a contributing factor to their distaste for this particular combination.Great product, just verify kitty flavor approval. I generally consider Keebler products to be definitely designed for children, and not appealing to adult sensibilities.  I bought these on chance because I love mint flavored products and they were on sale.  I fully expected to find them gagging and that I would have to give them away.Surprisingly they arent bad.  I wouldnt buy them again, since there are so many similar products which are better.  But they have good points.  Each bar is large, not as big as a candy bar, but close.  Each bar is individually wrapped, which I thought was overkill for a box of cookies, but that makes it easy to throw one into a lunch box or purse.  Note that you only get six cookies in the whole box.  The cookies are surprisingly light and crispy.  Definitely sweet, but not overly so, unlike many other Keebler products.  The mint flavor is fresh and not wimpy, and the chocolate flavor is mild but still pleasant.  The flavors overall are well balanced with emphasis on the mint, as it should be.Im not sure if these are designed for children or adults.  They seem much too large to be meant for children, and Im not sure if kids would enjoy this combination of flavors in this configuration. My basenji, Lily, loves Rawhide Munchy Sticks Beef 5\" 100 Pack and Chicken, 5\" 100 Pack best, but these are a great deal and she will chew happily on these as well.  I guess she is not too picky. The Grape Jam, itself, is of the highest quality, and it tastes great, so I have absolutely no complaints there. However, the glass jars were poorly packaged (it was very heavy and fragile, and was insulated with just two small pillow puffs), and two of the twelve jars arrived with the seals already broken. Since I could not be sure if the food was safe to eat, I had to throw away the two jars. I would not order this product again(or anything else that comes in jars) for that reason. Is this hot chocolate....yesIs this good hot chocolate....um, sortaIs this gourmet hot chocolate....not a chance.In my opinion, the only advantage you get but using the Green Mountain K-cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your Keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove-top. Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery.Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this.3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if youre looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping. I originally tried this as a part of a variety pack. Im glad I didnt buy the whole package. If you like richer hot chocolates, then you will not like this. I tried making this hot chocolate on all three settings (smaller, medium, larger cups on the three option Keurig machines). All of the options tasted too watery for me. I would often add creamer to try to substitute for the lack of flavor to them.  If this is a machine you have in your office and are looking for something different than coffee, it is, like the stars-rating claims, okay. It tastes like what it is - a mediocre hot chocolate they added to a coffee line to simply offer variety.Personally, I prefer to just use Swiss Miss packets and use the Keurig to heat the water. You get better taste (by a company known for hot chocolate) and the convenience of the Keurig machine. Plus, you save a lot of money. Definitely use the smallest amount of water and be sure to shake the cup before brewing.  The kids got a kick out of making their own \"kid coffee\" but this was only after we tweaked it with less water and brewed it with 3 marshmallows on top. (The hot cocoa hitting the marshmallows releases added sugar as well as turns the marshmallows nice and mushy :)The rest of us dont care to waste our daily calories on something that was, in our opinion, chocolatey water.  Still, it was worth the price for the simple fact that the kiddos can come in from sledding and brew their own hot cocoa without much mess. I enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate on a cold day. This is okay. You cant expect much when when all you use is water. I would say it is a bit better than the instant hot chocolate packets, but not by much. What I like the best is the easy factor. I can let my 9YO make her own cup without worrying about pulling hot water out of the micro and spilling it all over while trying to mix it like you do in the packets. So for that alone its a great deal. Price is not the best, but again the convienience is key. I like my hot chocolate to have alot of \"chocolatey\" flavor. Even when I use the smallest size brewing cup the Green Mountain hot cocoa K-cups tastes watered down. I have to add my own powdered hot chocolate to give it enough flavor. This product wad very weak! I couldnt even make out that it was supposed to be hot chocolate. Will never buy again a waste of money! I thought that getting hot cocoa would be a nice change, but after having my machine get clogged up, needing to clean the needles, and then putting a rinse brew after each cup is made, Ive found it faster to stick with the packet of instant mix and heat water in the microwave. I would not order these K-cups again.  Maybe Im spoiled with Godiva hot chocolate, but I think Swiss Miss hot chocolate has more chocolately flavor than these K-cups and I wouldnt waste my money on these.  It comes out a pinkish color that is not appetizing at all. Guys, do you know what \"malossol\" means in Russian?\"Lightly salted\".This particular caviar was actually over-salted quite a bit.Other than that its a very good tasting caviar (I guess you can blame a puddlefish for that), very close to Russian Sturgeons caviar. This product does not smell very well to me.  In fact, I have to use a fork to \"tenderized\" the pieces for my old kitty cat. I bought this product because my older cat stopped eating the wellness dry and wet food I usually fed her.  She likes this food and she begs for it every morning and evening when it is time for her meal.  The ingredients are not quality ingredients but this food is keeping my kitty satisfied. The one BIG problem being that they dont always send you the right product and when that happens there is no way to return it for the right product. I ordered 2 lbs of the honey and received brown sugar instead. When I tried to return it for the right product (the honey) I got absolutely NO RESPONSE. None. I sent countless emails, but nothing. It is a great product with a great taste, but the company is a little dodgy, so be careful. OK, I like a little richness. These nuts have a flavorful salt taste, but are almost too dry to get down your throat. I love these almonds. They are my favorite to date and I would definitely buy again. The taste is crunchy, they are well toasted and the salt that has been added is just perfect. Not too little, not too much. Best I have ever eaten!! Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that \"oven roasted\" + \"honey\" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They dont have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I dont have a container to compare, Im thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me. Initially I purchased this in good faith for brewing it as iced tea as it is quite difficult to find loose tea leaves in stores. Heres my initial report and impressions:The tea leaves came loose of course but the packaging is terrible. The bag is not sealed and the flap is just folded so tea leaves came out of the bag while in transport. So a lot of your tea leaves will be inside the box which is not good. I would hope that in the future Lipton chooses a better packaging alternative to seal the bag so you dont have tea leaves all over the place.And as another reviewer mentioned, it is true that this particular brand has little bits and pieces of tea leaves and is not as good quality compared to other brands. And as always, you pay for what you get. I didnt expect this to be better than my Jasmine tea in a tin can which costs about $45 and taste fantastic. My goal was to buy cheap black tea leaves which are loose to make lemon iced tea which I was able to do well with that.Here is my lemon iced tea recipe after a lot of trial and error and taste testing:-1 Gallon of Lemon Iced Tea-1. 1 Gallon of water2. 5-9 Tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea3. Empty teabags4. 1 cup of sugar5. 1/2 cup of lemon juiceLiptons direction call for 2 tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea to make 1 1/2 quarts of black tea to drink. We know that 4 quarts is equal to 1 gallon, if we used 4 tablespoons of black tea we would only end up with 3 quarts of tea which is short of one gallon. If 2 tablespoons makes 1 1/2 quarts then 1 tablespoon would make about .75 of a quart. So you would need at least a minimum of 5 tablespoons or even about 5 1/4 tablespoons of tea leaves to get your 4 gallons. I would not recommend using more than 9 tablespoons as it would make the tea too strong. Some people have said that the tea is too strong for the little amount that you use to brew your tea but I would have to disagree with that. I thought the tea wasnt strong enough.So go ahead and boil your water till you hit the boiling point. Use between 5-9 tablespoons depending on how strong you want your tea to be and fill up those empty teabags. The directions call for brewing your tea for about 3-5 minutes. Being a tea drinker I knew that if I brew it too long that tannins would be released and make the tea bitter (yes! tannins are what make your tea bitter). If your water is too hot or you brew your tea too long the tannins will be released in the leaves making your tea bitter. Initially I only brewed my tea for about 2 minutes because I was scared that the tea would be bitter if I brewed it too long. But I found that 2 minutes time was not enough time and increased my time to about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes. That is enough time to brew the tea without releasing the tannins so Liptons brewing time was about spot on. After you finish brewing your tea add your 1 cup of sugar and then your lemon juice. I used cane sugar and Hy-Top reconstituted lemon juice but you can use whatever brand you like or you can even use fresh squeezed lemon juice if you want. I did try Real Lemon Juice while at another supermarket but I didnt like it compared to my generic brand of lemon juice by Hy-Top.You probably wanted to know if I actually drank the tea without it being Lemon Iced Tea, and I did. I didnt like it nor would I recommend you drink this tea this way. I just did not feel that this tea was up to quality compared to many other brands. Maybe Ive just been spoiled by other brands but I just feel that this tea wasnt up to par against other black teas nor do I recommend drinking it as just plain black tea. I particularly like the English Breakfast Black Tea by Stash better than this tea. I just felt that the quality difference was a lot but I didnt feel like buying every bag for $0.09 each every time I went to the supermarket just to brew Lemon Iced Tea. If you want to make lemon iced tea with the Stash brand you need 9 English Breakfast Black Tea bags and the same amount of sugar, lemon juice, and water. Economical wise I would get more tea buying Lipton but if taste matters I would choose another tea brand to make Lemon Iced Tea.I havent tried making Raspberry Iced Tea with this yet but well save that for another adventure. I am a little dis appointed with this tea --  This was my first experience with loose tea --  initially this was good loose tea ---  after having tried for several months  -- I am dis appointed -- first it is a weak tea  --  I have tried brewing it  for long time changing my water settings and brew times and I keep getting same result  a weak tea  -- the amt of tea --  I just never seem to get the right mix  -- Save your money and buy a better quality tea than Lipton Loose Tea.  Tea is better than the bagged version but you will want to pour it through a fine filter before drinking because the leaves are broken and some are just very small particles. Lets get this out of the way - I regularly pop whole habanero peppers in my mouth and douse my food with Daves Ghost Pepper Insanity Sauce.  That being said, I was looking for the next taste bud hot challenge and figured Id give this a shot.They dont lie when they say its HOT.  I put a single drop on a tortilla chip and although I wasnt in pain, I was in moderate discomfort for about 10 minutes.  I think the thing that got to me the most was that the taste was just not very good.  Im no culinary expert and Im sure its extremely difficult to make something that hot taste good but compared to Daves Ghost Pepper Sauce it was bottom shelf in that department.  That being said, I will be giving it another chance soon, trying to incorporate it into a hot chili experiment.Bottom line: If youre after a sauce to spice up a dish and leave it (mostly) edible for everyone but the diehard hot lovers, Id recommend sticking with that sauce.  If youre reading these reviews though its clear that you want hot, and this sauce doesnt disappoint.Heat: 5 starsOverall product: 3 stars (for taste)Scoville Scale reference:Habanero ~ 250kDaves Ghost Pepper Sauce ~ 650kDa Bomb Hot Sauce ~ 1500k The dark chocolates were great and the packaging was great for ChristmasThe tin was something you dont see in America anymore.Perfect to reuse for candy or other things at christmas. I subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that its changing from 17 oz. to 16.9 oz. - but no price change?  WOW thats a really lame cut to increase their profit margins.  Whatever I wont miss the .1 oz. obviously but how about messaging and acknowledging your devoted consumers. I purchased this for Christmas 2011.  I love peppermint bark and like to try a new kind every year.  Its a very special yearly treat for me, so I expect a lot from the product.Pros for Scotts Cakes version:  Good organization and logistics:  the package arrived quickly, the candy was well wrapped in the shipping box and shrink-wrapped in a box of its own.  Candy was in good condition (i.e., no broken pieces) and fresh.This sellers peppermint bark achieves a nice mix of peppermint and white chocolate flavor.  White chocolate gives off a nice mellow tone; it is good quality.  There is no dark chocolate layer to upset the balance of peppermint and white chocolate flavors in ones mouth.  This attracted me to Scotts Cakes.Cons:  The quality of the peppermint pieces in the chocolate was very disappointing.  The ad mentions that the buyer should expect to see pieces of candy cane/peppermint starlight mints mixed with white chocolate.  The photo seems to support this claim, showing robustly sized pieces of candy cane in the bark.  I expected a very crunchy chewing experience, which I think is the hallmark of the best types of peppermint bark.  However, the pieces of peppermint candy are in reality very small; there is no sensation of crispness when taking a bite.  The peppermint candy has a chewy consistency, making it seem more like taffy.  Thus, there is no auditory pleasure in consuming this version of peppermint bark. Just to keep it simple...more of a comparison than a total review.  I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the \"World Market\" branded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)3. Not nearly as good as Tims Cascade Jalapeno chips.  (Tims has more pepper flavor, more spice, a little bit better crunch...but also have MSG.)Its not to say these chips are bad, but just what the 3-stars says \"Its OK.\"  There are better, there are worse...to me, these are right in the middle of the pack. I was expecting some \"serious flavor\" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips Ive had, its pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and its fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall Id say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips. Olive oil in large bold print on the front of the bag is misleading!!  Olive oil is NOT the main oil the chips are cooked in.  The product has more sunflower, corn and canola oils than it does olive oil!! The ingredients are NOT listed in the description.  I should have known better.There are other, much better \"Olive Oil\" potato chips on the market that use ONLY olive oil. I was quite disappointed in this brand. I ordered these because I had purchased a bag of Sweet maui Onion chips from the supermarket. They were so good that I had to get another.The order came and I popped open a bag. They are very crunchy, so if youre into that, these are the chips for you. However, they do tend to get really salty. I found myself having quite a few sips of beer when eating these I bought these potato chips because they sounded tasty and because of the natural sounding ingredients... but also specifically because they are gluten free.  I have a son with food allergies and he cannot gluten... or Milk.  I was so upset when I received these to find out that they contain Milk!  I do not see this information anywhere on the product page. These are great treats - in fact they are the only thing I use for my dog.  But this price seem way wrong - so far off as to possibly be incorrect??  In my local PetSmart they are $5.99. My fiance loves fortune cookies so I figured this would be a great creative way to pop the question. Well, she loved the idea when I finally did it last friday (although, somehow she had me figured out from the beginning lol).Anyway, I wasnt particularly thrilled about the quality of these cookies. The seams werent completely shut. I could see the word \"Will\" through the backside of the cookie.Also, a huge warning for someone looking for an authentic cookie to give.... the wrapper is just that, a plain plastic wrapper. I was expecting some Chinese lettering or some kind of design to make it a little more believeable.And last but not least, the price. For the quality youre getting, Id be more inclined to try the trick (tutorials online) of opening up a cookie and placing the message inside myself. At least then I could put exactly what I wanted. They are way overpriced for what youre getting.Buy only out of desperation. Stuff inside is good. But olive oil containers should be dark to block sunlight. And I prefer glass containers to plastic. Shucks! Ive ordered the same extra virgin olive oil before, however, at the time I paid $25 for 2 LITERS, not 1.5. Next time I have to pay better attention to size & price. Not saying the oil isnt worth it, just have to shop for better prices!I am editing my review b/c I realized only after Ive ordered & used the oil for the first time that I mistakenly orderd the organic kind. Again, Kirklands extra virgin olive tastes great, but for me it doesnt have to be the organic kind to make it special. The price seems just about right if not even super for this type of quality & \"organi\" label. I used to love EVERY flavor of these cokies. I was the one buying out the entire shelf at WFoods. I started ordering on amazon multiple 8 packs at a time.  I could easily eat 2 boxes a day by myself!  I eat really healthy and my sweets is the only thing I give myself what I want.  I am vegan and \"prefer\" to eat gluten free, as I am supposed to due to healh issues, but dont always because there are no other GF desserts that are vegan that I LOVE.  So BOY was I disappointed when I had to stop buying them very mcuh because they changed the fat and calories significantly.  I wonder i anyone else noticed.  I wrote to Dr. Lucy and she replied.  I asked if I could still order some from her int he original formulation, or where I could buy them like that, but she said no.  The only reasons she gave were some type of problem with the formulation and baking f the cookie, but I dont understand beacause they were perfect??!  A better explanation would have been nice.  So thus, I am very disappointed in this line, which was the ONLY GF, VEGAN, LOW FAT/LOW CAL, DELICIOUS!!! line of desserts I enjoyed, and now cannot eat them very often at all.  When I am consuming large amounts, Im sorry but 25g of fat for a whole box vs. 7.5 g fat/box for the old cookies?  Cant do it. Dang Lucy....I miss my sweet yumminess. These cookies are very similar to garden variety wheat based chocolate chip cookies, they have similar texture and snap, but these are both vegan and gluten free, which matches my requirements.  My celiac disease makes me very sensitive to wheat and these cookies do not trigger any reaction.The cookies are if anything a little more crisp than most, but not at all hard or difficult to chew.  They certainly contain sugar.  I do not eat these everyday because they are so sweet, but I do like them and may very well subscribe to them.If I were rating these only on flavor and texture Id give them 4 stars, but Lucy annoyed me by creating a bizzarre nutrition panel.  Each package contains 4 cookies.  They state it is 1.3 servings, then go on to say one serving has 130 calories.  So each package seems to contain 169 calories, possibly over some peoples limit for a snack.  But lets be honest, these cookies with lots of organic cane sugar have a lot of calories.  Each cookie must weigh in at a bit over 40 calories.For years we have known that 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.  Now we know it is a cookie worth of calories too, tasty calories.  Will buy again. If you like an almond this is a good product and it is cheaper than the name brand. To me this product taste the same as the name brand, I like paying less and having the same taste! I should have been more aware of the price at local stores for this product.  Walgreens had these exact almonds for $2 less/per bag that week.  They are delicious, though. ...but the cans were smaller than I expected for the price I paid.  I dunno, I just expected to be saving a lot more than that when buying in bulk.  Its the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesnt sell for some reason) and I couldnt stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds arent the best for snacking in large quantities, and I wont explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and its a decent price (considering youre not paying sales tax outside of NY and that theres free shipping if youre patient) so I cant not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity. Purchased this item to try.  Had to purchase the case, I believe 3 big bottles.  It wasnt what I expected, but now I have 3 big bottles to use.  I will share at work and with my family, if I can get them to take some. Im a big Juan Valdez colombian fan. This Jamaican stuff doesnt have the kick that I love from coffee. Its sorta flat. Especially for something I spent $75 for two lbs. Goin Back To Colombian (twang twang) Believe it or not, I bought this at a yard sale for 50 cents.  The packaging was perfect and looked exactly like the photo.  It doesnt expire for another 6 months.  I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, Ill never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-) I bought this coffee after watching a documentary on Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, thinking it would taste exceptional compared to regular coffee.  This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  We brewed it in the drip coffee maker and also tried it in the French press and neither one of us were impressed.  At this point, our preferred coffee is Dunkin Donuts Original Blend...its much cheaper and more readily available. I found these for 1/2 the cost on the direct website with a free gift of lava cakes as well. Makes a great gift :) Hint, pour on a bit of seafood sauce with horseradish in it and microwave a few seconds to warm up.I just tried a can of these for breakfast this morning.  There were about 9.5 ounces of actual sardine in there and the rest was sauce.  Still not bad considering thats the equivalent of just over two cans of sardines for somewhere under three dollars if you buy them 24 at a time.The fish werent the freshest tasting Ive had, but they werent that bad either.  At least theyre the medium size sardine fish and not the herring you find in the really cheap sardine cans.Heres way to beat the recession and get your protein and calcium. 810 MILIGRAMS OF SALT PER SERVING is not a healthy amount!  Yet theother ingredients in this condensed soup make it SO delicious, evena \"salt counter\" like myself finds it hard to resist!  THIS IS NOTA SNACK-FOOD!  It needs to be MIXED with other, preferably totallysalt-free ingredients!  Not only a soup can be made with this\"condensed yumminess\".  I have used it, (with salt-free tuna and/orsalmon), instead of mayonaise, and added bread crumbs, for adelicious tuna spread!So -- enjoy this condensed soup!  Just be aware of the absolutelyt-r-e-m-e-n-d-o-u-s amount of dangerous sodium in it, and drink,eat, and cook with it, accordingly................................................................NOTE TO CAMPBELLS: I realize that salt here is used as a preservative.  But VITAMIN E is also a good preservative.  Perhapsyou could use less salt and more vitamin E to preserve your soups?I hope so!  And will be looking forward eagerly to the day whenyou do!  Thanks! Brew style: french press, espressoSmell: Nothing special here, decent coffee smell with some earthiness.  No caramel notes, no sweetness.Taste: Mild, earthy, somewhat smokey, dirty mouth feel, finish is short.I mostly brew with a french press but i tried it in my espresso maker just to see how it would fair.  The caffeine seemed very pronounced to me, there was no sweetness to speak of.  It did have a very nice crema though.Overall: I wont be buying this again, its nothing special. I recently discovered buying coffee on Amazon and have fallen in love with the convenience.  I decided to try this based on the rave reviews.  Wish I wouldnt have listened.  Not nearly as good as I expected.  Note that it doesnt taste bad, its just that it doesnt have much taste at all.Also disappointed in the packaging.  The companies seal on the coffee is a joke and the coffee was all over my Amazon box when it showed up.  This could be another reason the coffee did not taste very fresh since it was not air tight.  Will continue to search other coffees on Amazon. Read the reviews and thought this coffee was 5 stars.  Received the coffee and proceeded to open the package. What wasnt there was any aroma. Had to stick my nose inside the package to even smell if it was coffee. Caramel? Well I proceeded to brew a cup. Smelled like normal 3 star coffee, tasted like plain ole coffee. Nothing special just plain ole coffee. I fell for the hype and gave it a try. I agree it has the caramel hints, which I guess is just not for me because caramel is a tad salty, and I loathe that briney taste at the back of my tongue when drinking coffee. Im OK being very subtly reminded of dark chocolate, but no other flavors appeal to me when it comes to coffee.  Im going back to my favorite, Cafe Altura Biodynamic organic French roast, which is the closest Ive found to the rich, deep, bold coffee Ive had in Paris.  Ive also had good luck with the San Francisco dark roast I used to find at Costco.  Other great dark roasts Ive found include Black Swan (Woodinville, WA) and Hailey Coffee Company (Hailey, ID) camerons organic velvet moon is way better. Comparing the two products this product isnt what it is hyped up to be. I loved the packs with the flavors, except the chocolate covered. They were horribly melted into one great big discolored glob. Figures, with temps over 100 in SoCal everyday during the summer. I cant blame anyone. It is what it is. Excellent size and not too many are broken, but they may be RAW, not ROASTED, so beware. Would be nice if the merchant was more explicit or offered options.I bought these for my wife who is somewhat salt intolerant, so would buy again IF they were prepared (or presented) properly.UPDATE: Contacted the vendor, who apparently has a problem with English, and does the \"run around\" game, so BEWARE. Purchased this in hopes of flavoring coffee without sweetening it.I didnt find the flavor to be all that amazing but it was ok.If you made coffee with it then asked me to guess the flavor I wouldnt be able to.Maybe because I know its supposed to be macadamia nut that Im looking for the flavor and can find it?In the end I am still trying to find  good macadamia nut flavor. Tasty Syrup, but I was walking the aisle at my local superstore and found the exact same product for $3 less. And I dont live anywhere near vermont. Ah well - its still great stuff! And my pancakes thank me. at $12 for 2.1 ounces, no wonder one cant pull up the bag to see details.Like $80 per pound! I was thinking 1 lb would be a lot more than what it actually came out to be. Especially since starch is somewhat light, and since it was $8. I wish they sold this in larger quantities. I frequently buy Post Shredded Wheat, and decided to try this new cereal because its made of whole grain wheat.  My teenage children had the same opinion about Caramel Delight that I did...they liked it as an occasional high fiber snack, but its way too sweet as a cereal!  General Mills should reduce the sugar, and instead increase the insoluble fiber in this cereal. That would make it perfect! This cereal makes getting your fiber easier, but it does not taste as good as the other products in the same line. I was expecting \"Caramel Delight\" to have a powerful caramel flavor, but found it lacking. Its not that the cereal is inedible - it tastes fine, but the flavor gets a little lost once you add milk. Its like youre eating \"healthy\" cereal - the \"clusters\" options make it much easier to feel like youre indulging and taste much better. Just be warned - dont eat too much. Dont snack on it like its popcorn. Its got fiber, even if you cant taste it - and your body will let you know when youve had too much. I bought this -- just one box, not a six-pack -- on sale at a store. I cant believe how easy it is to get your fiber if you eat this cereal. Most cereals dont have even half this much fiber in them. Im actually eating candy coated sawdust.I know that chicory root is a tree... that Im eating sawdust... but theres so much sugar I cant stop.  It doesnt really taste like caramel to me.  It felt more like drinking maple syrup out of the bottle.  If youve tried it, youll probably agree.  Its like eating maple syrup.Im going to do some research now because Im having trouble thinking or breathing.  The beeping from my insulin pump isnt helping.Carbs in 1 serving Count Chocula: 23Carbs in 1 serving Trix: 18Carbs in 1 serving Crunch Berries: 29Carbs in 1 serving Reeces Puffs: 23Carbs in 1 serving Fiber One Caramel Delight Cereal: 41 The best in fiber, as crunchy flakes.

This product seems to have replaced a similar previous product (Natural Himalayan Crystal Salt). The previous prodcut was a deeper pink color and the texture was better than what I was finding elsewhere. This new product (Himalayan Organic Natural Unprocessed Cooking Salt) is much more like what the competitors are selling. Ive enjoyed all my products from The Spice Lab, but was disappointed with the replacent for this product. Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon). For a friend who loves jellies and turtles . He said they were soft and chewy just the ways he likes them and even though they were his favourite animal he couldnt stop eating em . Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly wont taste it.  My son liked them, so they wont go to waste.  I would not buy them again. These seeds are on the edge of their sell by date. (11/11)  Not very good for the small scale gardener who wants to save some for next year.  Germination rates are at about 1/4.  Too early to tell much about the plants, but I will update again if they do well. This isnt the best tasting pepperoni, but its acceptable, and you certainly get a lot of it for the money. This does NOT taste like peperoni. More like Slim Jim, except this uses real sausage casing (Slim Jim uses paper...shhh.) Ive recently been researching the work of Dr. Price and the X-factor that high vitamin butter, combined with fermented cod liver oil, will cause teeth to re-mineralize and stop tooth decay. If this is why you want to purchase this product, DO NOT. Im sure its fine for ghee, but when I switched from the pricey butter oil to this, I found cavities were growing. When I switched back, they stopped growing. Again, this is great for ghee, but dont use as part of preventing/curing tooth decay as Dr. Prices research recommends. Overall, the bags of popcorn were just like those that youd get in a regular package of 8 or 12 bags.  However, several bags did not pop correctly (or at all) and had to be thrown out.  Also, many other bags would have a burnt hole after popping.  I realize that some of this variability could be due to microwave wattage, but it was only bags from this large box of Orville Redenbachers that would do this.  I think when you order such a large box, your chances of getting \"dud\" bags increase...just something to keep in mind!  Is it worth it to buy in bulk when more of the bags will be duds? I love Orville Redenbacher and so I ordered a case. Unfortunately, It looks old and the bags are weeping butter. The popcorn tastes OK when it does fully pop, if you can get pass that...what am I saying? Buy the 3 pack and try it out first. Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you cant find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some \"healthy\" pastas available, but Im just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and thats your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal. Is this price correct?  $46.34 works out at over $7 a lb!  I am sorry, but for this price I would not buy from this supplier.  This is just a ridiculous price.  Walnuts can be purchased ANYWHERE for less than $5. per lb. It is a nice looking storage option and saves space, but I expected the drawer to slide out without so much difficulty. It is very jerky and tough to pull out and and push in. I thought maybe I did something wrong but it is pretty simple. I applied some WD 40 to the slide (with much wiping to get the excess off) and that did not help.Has anyone else had this trouble, and were you able to remedy it? I purchased this product over a year ago, and the best I can say is this is an ok product for me, but could be perfect for you.I used to always reach up to the top shelf, grab my box of k-cups, sift through them to find what I wanted, and then make my coffee. I tried to use the wooden box, but when you can only hold 20, and you use multiple k-cups per day, I just felt like I was always filling it, and didnt have enough room for variety.I bought this thinking it was perfect, holding 36 cups should last me a few weeks minimum. The Keurig would sit right on top and take up less room. What more could I ask for? Then when I brought it home though the truth came out.The draw is very well made and works perfect. However you are adding about 3 inches to the size of the keurig. Due to the height of my cabinets, it raised the machine just enough to not longer be able to open enough because the handle hits the cabinet. For a few days I was pulling it out and using it like that, but that got too annoying. Instead I now use the draw, but not with my coffee maker on it. It now holds my knife block instead, since those can still come out just fine.If your keurig is set up with no cabinet above it, this option is beyond perfect. However for me, I feel like it just added a bit of clutter, but I am willing to deal with it for the convience of the drawer. First off I very much prefer this look to the rotating holders, plus it holds MORE K cups than they do.  I also like that it takes up less storage space than those carousels plus a machine.  I have limited counter top space and it is already crowded.A minor issue, as I had read before, was that the added height to the machine causes lid to hit the cupboards while opening and closing. I am OK with pulling it away from the wall a bit and will eventually place my machine in a more open counter space to avoid this.  It does bother my husband more though.I was disappointed with the product a bit.  My main problem was the material on the top of the drawer, that you rest the machine on, was not done very aesthetically.  AS soon as I opened what stood out to me was that it had to have been hand cut, and was cut slightly wrong on my product.  First I can still see the pencil mark all across the front.  Then it was cut too short and  coroner was not cut squarely.  It happens to h ave also been across the front edge of my product so it just sticks out to me and lessens its appeal.I find the drawer to operate smoothly and easily.  you can not reach the back row of K-cups while full but that is not a big deal to me at all. Ordered this on the advice of the Single Serve Coffee forum.CONS:Drawer is metal mesh on metal mesh, so it doesnt slide smoothly.  Its pretty clunky to pull open and even harder to close.It doesnt pull out far enough to reach the back of the drawer, so you have to tip the final K-Cup out, which is hard if you have an entire coffee maker on top.Again, all mesh, so the cups dont sit smoothly in the tray, and the sections are a hair too narrow so the cups brush one another awkwardly.My upper cabinets are raised higher than average because we are both tall, and this still didnt leave us enough room to open the maker while on the drawer.PROS:For our modern kitchen, its nice to look at.It comfortable fits my Capresso FrothPro on one side and two 64oz Ghirardelli bottles (front to back) on the other so it still saves us counter space.When I tried my Keurig on it, I expected some buckling but it seemed to stand firm even with a full water tank.All in all, for $25 its a lot nicer to look at than the spinning barrel style holders, and I dont need my coffee to be on display.  Plus it looks easy to clean which for me is a plus. First off Im very happy that my Keurig Coffeemaker sits nicely atop this storage drawer without having to take up any extra counter space. But on the other hand its difficult to reach the last K-cup in the very back of the drawer. I can live with it but they should have designed it so the drawer extended out a bit more for easy access. I dont know if I have bad one (doubt it), but it doesnt slide well unless you lift up on it.  Its like the tracks are too tight, and if you try pulling straight out, it hangs, and then the cups inside go flying when it finally does slide because you end up jerking it. When I added this to the cake it was so beautiful that I couldnt believe it! Even the customer was impressed! It made the cake look more professional for someone whos still learning to make beautiful cakes. I bought these in Mid-July (09) with 2 day delivery along with 4 other flavors.  This is my least favorite.  I still have the original bunch while Ive finished the others and have re-ordered them.  For some reason, there is an after-taste that I really dont like with this flavor.  Wish I did like it.  I will keep getting the others through Subscribe and Save as long as they are available.  The others are great when I dont want to cook a full breakfast or lunch. I do freeze and microwave them, then drink a cup of milk with them.  Very filling and satisfying.  I recommend the other flavors Ive tried but not this one.  Ive tried and like the Oatmeal and Raisin, the Banana Walnut,  the Chocolate Chunk, and the Apple and Caramel flavors.  YMMV The cookies at first taste good but it follows up with an interesting after taste.  It is also a little dry had to down a whole glass of milk but overall it wasnt too bad. It is just okay to me. This products flavor does not impress me as much as the vegan choc chunk ones offered by Erin. I knew before buying that the ingredients werent all that wholesome: evaporated cane juice, enriched wheat flour, what are those doing in a breakfast? If a product is claiming to be a healthy breakfast, it should really have 100% unadulterated ingredients. (Ill give the Erin Bakers brand its due for using aluminum-free baking powder.) All that having been said, if you regard this as a cookie rather than a meal replacement, youll be happy with it. Its healthy for a cookie, tastes decent, and fantastically convenient (take it out of the freezer in the morning and its good to go in 2 hours without heating). But despite what other reviewers have said, its a high-calorie snack at best. I am a 115 lb female and this barely held me over for about 2 and a half hours before I was starving again. If youre someone with a small appetite, try packing it with a piece of fruit-- Bottom line, its a healthy cookie, not breakfast, much less a healthy breakfast. I love Erins Breakfast Cookies, but this flavor is a little to rich for me.  It gives me that funny feeling in the back of my throat. I purchased these with high hopes because I do not seem to have enough time to eat a great breakfast, but I thought this would provide sustenance til lunchtime; however, I was disappointed after a few bites. While the cookie is wholesome and filling, it does have a slight aftertaste.  To me it seemed like \"something\" was missing...not sure what, since there are many good ingredients, but I think I would have enjoyed apple/cinnamon much better.Also, I also found it disturbing that even though my cookies were not frozen (probably should have done this since they are a moist cookie) and not yet expired (January 2011), they were stored on the pantry shelf, as they are individually wrapped...but they became moldy. Yep. I just threw away three cookies because I could see mold through the package (opened one to confirm it). Yuck. If I hadnt scored these during a Warehouse sell-off, Id even more seriously fail to understand how or why anyone could justify paying over a dollar a piece for these things. Sure, the instructions are dead-on with the freeze-before-toasting method, but they have more ingredients than healthy cookies I can make at home for MUCH cheaper, and with superior texture and without the garbage. If you think these are healthy OR a good value, youve been duped. I bought these walnuts hoping theyd have a fresh, natural taste, better than the packaged nuts I find at my local grocery.  Unfortunately, the nuts I received had somehow absorbed a strong taste of plastic.  I took them out of the plastic tubs they were packed in and put them in another container I use that does not transfer odors or tastes onto the food.  Even so, after several weeks these nuts still tasted very unpleasantly of plastic. I buy these crackers because I need something gluten free to snack with.  But why does gluten free have to be so salty? I have to wipe the salt off to be able to eat them.  Wish the manufacturers would learn that just because we are glten free doesnt mean we can eat all that salt.  Less salt please! The product is a known value to us and is fresh. The physical condition of the  product leaves something to be desired. The individual wafers are often broken up, to the extent of 30% of the contents of the package. This indicates careless packing for the rigors of package shipment. The use of a somewhat larger outside box with the air bag padding on all sides should be better for the physical care of the contents. My wife eats the thins for lunch very often with meat, cheese or fish and finds the broken ones unsatisfactory. Ive purchaesed twice so far and in both boxes the gum was really hard.  Product is great, but I wouldnt purchase again through amazon due to it being so hard to chew. so i tried the garlic one and i made a mistake.... and didnt wear a gas mask when i used it ... i LOVE garlic but wow this is over powering in powder form when i first got it i opened it up to give it a smell and almost fell over it was like i got mased eyes tearing up nose burning regardless i bought it im trying it and i mix up some sausage and if you add water like it says it gets toned down so you can work with it after stuffing it and letting it sit for 24hrs for the casing to firm up i grilled them and im not impressed its not bad like someone just dumped a bunch of garlic powder in my sausage and no other spices i feel like it needs more flavor then JUST garlic powder i mean even salt and pepper would be nice This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch. I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat. good flavor! these came securely packed... they were fresh and delicious! i love these Twizzlers! I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener.Great deal for the price. McCanns Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCanns is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. Its even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCanns variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.McCanns use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCanns use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCanns becomes too thick and gluey. This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you dont have time to make McCanns Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they dont require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart. McCanns Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)Im a fan of the McCanns steel-cut oats, so I thought Id give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but wont make you bloat. I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL .) HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE ,IN MY STASH . SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN . FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK . IT GOES GOOD WITH O.J. AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD...OR THE DAY AT LEAST..  JERRY REITH... I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and Ill order this brand again, but not the variety. Ill get all Maple and Brown Sugar. This wasnt in stock the last time I looked. I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newtons Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup.Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts. They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms. It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run. They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work. I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg. Im going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes.Youll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin Peanuts.P.S. Im not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and Ill probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas. Hell be so insulted. I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and Ive roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively. Great gift for all ages! I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much, they kept them and would not eat them. Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldnt accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund. The crust on these tarts are perfect.  My husband loves these, but Im not so crazy about them.  They are just too sour/tart for my taste.  Ill eat the crust and hubby takes my filling.  My kids think theyre great, so maybe its just me. Ive been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, youll love this product. Too bad its way too expensive here on Amazon. Its only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart. I love this flavor of ramen! I dont eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and dont have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isnt bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store. I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because its bite size its easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping. Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand.If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s/h its a good deal.The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself.  It actually tastes pretty good. Im not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot. The tuna tastes like its good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. Its better than something plain but it didnt pack the punch I was hoping for. Its still a great option for a low calorie, low fat meal. I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago. This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like. This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good. It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative. Sure wish I could order the frozen juice! Couldnt believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime. If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended.I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation. After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.Love this stuff. I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for $4.00 a case of tweleve not paying $38.00 Yes 3 for a dollar. I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price. I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didnt expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  Ive only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now Im introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :) I like these better than the regular Altoids, but theyre even more costly, so youd better like them. I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to. Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet. When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin! One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said, theyre a real hit. Since I wouldnt be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and its nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they arent as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as its full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesnt make it easy to deal with). Dont buy just a few of these!  I order these by the case.  I cant even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite. Makes a tasty, super easy meal, fast. BUT high in calories.The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first. The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess. I made it with snow peas and carrots only. I dont like the little corn.  Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice.  It came out wonderful! Dinner on the table in less than 30mins. The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I cant say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when theyre sitting on our laps but, you know. Theyre dogs.When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, dont get me wrong and they loved it more when wed mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think Ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- cant blame the food itself for gluttony.Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they dont like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better. I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries. Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea. Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste. I am chemical sensitive as well as sugar-free. I have been using this product for over a year. I use it maybe once a week at the most. I drink 1/2 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel. IMO this doesnt replace my a.m. coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade. Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout. Ive been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years. Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this. This product is clean and doesnt leave nasty chems behind in the body. Try it before you judge from a review - everyones body reacts differently. Its just sugar in the raw, its flavor profile is much better then white sugar and its suppose to be better for you or something. I just wish the bags were resealable. This is a delicious sugar. It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma. But the granules are quite big, however -- bigger than plain refined sugar. This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together. But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it, or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it, it is a great product. It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer. I only use raw sugar, it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good. Will buy again. Cant say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw.  I like it better than the other \"natural\" sugars. Better consistency and - I know it doesnt matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the \"natural\" paper bags got torn a bit in the box.  It didnt look like the box was damaged so I cant tell how it happened, but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it.  Not sure what the solution is and Id order it again, but if it happens again, Id switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag. The energy shot truly does work! It had a terrible after-taste at first, but now that I know what to expect, I am getting used to it. I always have some water handy as a chaser...which helps! I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages. Its helped me kick my addiction to Diet Coke and other aspartame-laced caffeinated beverages. Yay!!! I loved this mold!  I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion, but it didnt last.  I did use it to make 30+ suckers for my daughters first birthday. But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that.  I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions, but for the price it didnt matter to me that much.  It served its main purpose :) Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product. We had no problem with the shipment, but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight. Other than that we are happy :D I have a slightly different version of this - different brand.  My son started using it around six months, and he really enjoys it.  He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon, but whatever...  Anyway, I also had trouble cleaning it, until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush.  That works pretty well.  It takes some time, but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender, or cut it up, then clean it up off him, the chair, the floor, the dog, me, well you get the picture. This product is amazing. I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them!! Super easy to clean and use. When ordering these, I was under the impression that there were 2 per package...FYI-theyre not!! Only one per... Great stuff and dependable, especially when there are a million brands \"out there\" to choose from.  I love the stuff.  For really high end desires, I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California.  But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again. I hadnt tried (or heard of) till recently Weavers not its my favorite. I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and havent found one yet, theyre all so darned smooth. No bite, no after taste, a little pricy but still worth it. No worse price wise than starbucks or peets. Will keep running through the list here and see what happens. Love them all so far. \"Nantucket Blend coffee is one of my favorites.  I was suprised that it was a single box.  every time I ordered before it was a 2 pack.  My fault for not reading closer.  I will not order any more at this price for 1 (24 count) When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors. Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. Id never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured Id give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And Im glad I did.The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isnt anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options weve been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods weve accumulated, Ill probably pick up a box of these as well.Now that I know Green Mountain isnt completely disappointing Ill definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE\">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.If youre looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup! I was looking for a replacement for Timothys Kona Blend which is no longer carried on Amazon.  This coffee from Green Mountain is very nice, but not strong enough for me.  If you like milder coffees, then this one is for you. Although there were several \"shriveled\" ones, they taste just fine.  I mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they dont have to look perfect anyways.  For the price, they are a great deal (about half of what I find them for in the store) I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants. Plus, he likes nuts, pecans, almonds peanuts. He loved these. I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin, so he could take one to work, or his place, and stay fresh longer. Although I dont think freshness will be an issue, they wont last long......lol We are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy.They taste fine for our family- we like them many ways! These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap.  The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store.I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies. We ate them all! Great if you are cutting back on fat, they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them. Extremely dry and hard. I buy mostly for vending, so the size of the bag is important. Kettles 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. Salt & Vinegar flavor is satisfying, about an 8 out of 10. Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. Its hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10. I love Kettle Brand Chips!Ive been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips. I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag. These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and \"spices.\" Im not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions \"tear here.\" So easy. Why didnt I think of that. Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste. I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesnt smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isnt a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesnt ruin the bag at all.Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover! In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best Ive ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice. these chips are good, and bad, and create moral dilemmas constantly. If wou are strong at will, or having a large BBQ go for it, but as for me, i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days, had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it. BEWARE They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tims or Zacks chips in that they are very crispy.On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime. It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you. They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends. These are delicious.  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving. I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of \"brown\" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you havent eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag. Eat at your own risk.  Once I would open a bag I could not stop.  Good and salty. My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however. Just got this order and it is ok. A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me, if it is there. Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything youd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldnt describe it as Thai.  Its more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any munchers snack cupboard. Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone.But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eatvery many. That makes them an indulgence thatrescues some people from overindulgence. Amazons suggestion for a 4 star review is \"I like it.\"  That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips.  These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds dont appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor.  The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me... I love these chips, which is why I bought them, to stock up for the entire school year. The chips taste great, and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived. The box on the other hand was in tatters, with holes and complely squished... I dont know if that was a result of customs or the voyage, but to receive it was a bit disgruntling given it was falling apart. Luckily, there were no victims within. All the chips are as they should be. If you like spicy, then these are for you.  I like spicy, so I enjoyed these.  Theyre also crunchy, as kettle-cooked chips should be. Chips are not as tangy as I hoped or expected. Poore Brothers is a better choice for the \"hard-core\" Salt N Vinegar fans. These chips are VERY GOOD!! I couldnt stop eating them. They didnt last very long.The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open. Im not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy, you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier. They are good but wish they were also baked. Have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere. If there are any I wish someone would post. I dont know what to say that others have not covered. If you like potato chips you will like these. Get em on sale when you can and limit your intake...if you can... When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. Id say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, Id try a different flavor since these are a little sweet. My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . . These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is theyre very oily. I understand theyre \"kettle chips\" and theyre \"fried\" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (Thats another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) theres a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious! These chips are delectably delicious. I am on a low sodium diet. I didnt have to give up totally something that I truely love to snack. These chips are bursting with flavor, and you cant really tell they are missing all that salt. There is just a kiss worth on a chip, but beleive me, it is a total makeout!!! These are my new favorite!  I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you wont be disappointed. I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasnt expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didnt mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips dont have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars. For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less \"natural\" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and thats why Ive given them 4 stars instead of 5. The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lays potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.I reccomend them! I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces. This kettle chips taste \"Good , Crispy & Crunchy \" too ! U will enjoy it also! Moreover,its thinly cut & sliced! So I got this and tasted it strait out of the bottle, it tasted like smoky flavored milk - YUCK! I was depressed I was stuck with 4 bottles of this.  It sat on my shelf and I forgot about it. Last weekend I tasted a Zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor, it tasted weird and smokey like the LorAnn oil I had gotten.  I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream - IT TASTED AMAZING!!!  The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel.So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too.  I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it, it tasted fine.  Then I added ONE DROP of the oil, it is very strong, and stirred it in - IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER!  I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat.Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream.  It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it.  When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream.It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting, if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch. Good quality nectar.  Very tasty.However, I was expecting 46 fluid ounces, not 46 ounces in weight.I find that 46 ounces in weight makes about 32 fluid ounces. I used to buy the Wholesome Sweetners agave and like it a little better, but switched because it became too expensive. So this is the cheeper option. The taste is the same, but it seems a little less sweet because I find I have to use more of it to get the right sweetness in my coffee. I dont like the container. It doesnt pour well, so I have to pour it into a better squeeze bottle, so that I dont have a sticky mess on my counter every day. Its fine for the price. I continue to have it shipped to me every other month. We have been using 17-Day Diet guided by Low-Glycemic eating for about 6-7 months, with fair success. This amber agave nectar has become our primary sweetener because of the low glycemic effect on blood sugar. The taste is mellow,and the sweetening power is higher than sugar [so you use less], but without the \"twang\" of honey. the one thing I have not tried it on (still using sugar) is making kombucha - I still use sugar, as Im not sure it would be a good idea to introduce a raw element into kombucha. But actually, that may just be my own over-caution and nothing related to actual chemistry or circumstance.Our primary uses are sweetening yogurt, using it in the little baking I do, and use in salad dressings, fruit desserts, etc. Because we are limiting our sweets consumption,we dont use a lot of this, but its nice to have when we need it. I plan to try using it in some homemade jams later this season. I buy it on subscription, and the cost is about 33% less than the local WalMart and more than 50% less than the health food store on this same brand. \"Best by\" date on the bottles I received in May is 2015. These chips are a great snack if you dont want all the junk assiciated with chips.  Try them youll like them. I love these chips. The flavor is not plain. They are sweet and spicy all at the same time.  The only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt. But, it still a great flavor! These chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa. The texture is brittle and thin, like other Plockys chips.The only downside: the spice is minimal. I think Plockys brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but I found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy. These chips are the only ones I found to be tasty and healthy. They have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition--the perfect blend! These spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned, you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards! The first time I ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing I could taste them in my mouth the next morning. So just be careful about when you eat them, especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day. I love these chips and ordered them after I had some in Florida.  My case of chips came without any packing inside.  All bags in a box with no cushioning at all.  Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they cant package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money. I bought thi9s for my dad for a surprise birthday present because he could not find them any where else!! I really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here. Unlike some of the mass-production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring, Tasselfields pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference. You can even taste the fibers from pineapple.I opted for the traditional pineapple this time. I will be interested in trying out the Longan or mango variety next time. Well worth the money. I did the calculations on different bags and this dollar amount  is an excellent value. There are approx 2338 pops in the box. So far Ive been through about half the box and have found about 3 without wrappers. Thats pretty good considering. If you need 30lbs of dum-dums go for this product. Enjoy. This is pretty good regular style soy sauce.  But it is not super-wonderful-better than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market.  The main value is as a unique gift.  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesnt have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikomans full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I havent tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.  Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite.  If you want a unique Kentucky gift for an Asian friend, this is different than the standard bottle of Bourbon or box of chocolate. most soy sauce is from Japan but they are having problems with radiation in their soy bean fields. I am not sure how long the contamination will last. I like the idea this product claims no GMO seeds. yea  You pay more but decided not to take a chance on Japan. I have tried about 75% of the available T-Discs, and the Kona Blend is one of the best regular/unflavored coffees for Tassimo. It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering, and has a pleasant aroma. Personally, I would enjoy it more if it were stronger/bolder. However, being a bit mild, it goes well with breakfast and/or (gluten-free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect, nor is a subscription service available. Originally found this at (Dead Bats from) Beyond, used a 20% coupon, and was happy with the final price. The Milka Naps Mix Gift Box is a fun, unique gift for those tired of Whitmans and the usual American brands. Nothing wrong with Whitmans, but sometimes a change of look and flavor is nice.As a sampler, it provides only a few of the Milka options. Four flavors are here: noisette, hazelnuts, alpine milk and strawberry. All are delicious, though I dont like strawberry/chocolate (in any candy) personally, and give those away to eager friends. The Naps box are perfect for coffee tables and as a standalone dish at work.Milka and its famous purple cow, is owned by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries.Distribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hersheys and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate.I fully recommend the Milka Naps Mix Gift Box.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com Great candy and our family loved it.  It was smaller than I imagined it and I thought it was expensive for how small it was.  However, I am in Germany and can get it easier here.  The shipping to the USA makes it expenive.  Great product and fun for our USA family to receive. Really easy project for family fun anytime not just for Christmas. Just put icing between cookies and stack. Then ice outside and decorate. Great for all ages.

My son is a SB fanatic so I was so excited to find this for the 2010 holiday season as every year we do some version of gingerbread. I knew by reading reviews that there wouldnt be enough yellow frosting so I whipped up so edible glue (water and confectionery sugar) to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside - this worked great. It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating. The licorice was worthless though... These cookies were fun to paint but not too tasty to eat!The kids did not really care much, but it might have beenmore fun if they could have eaten them.They really had fun coloring them! This tea is the best tea ive ever had. i first tasted it in norway, and had to find it in the states. i have it every morning. strawberry twist has a long-lasting pleasant flavor SWEET-but, not excessively so. delivery is timely and price is just right. Supieror to other TRIDENT flavors! Though, SPEARMINT isnt bad either. My next pick would be blueberry I bought this for my one year old Cocker. However all the dogs love it. All their coats look better, they all shed less, eat less, use the bathroom less, my Cocker used to have this one chronic ear since the time I have had her as a puppy that it just gave her problems. It seems to have cleared up, no more smell. Her eyes give her less problems. And my 7yr old Yorkie he eats less, he used to throw up all the time had the most sensitive tummy. Our black lab mix, hot spots and she would just lick her fur off. All these great changes in a matter of a month.  I do mix it roughly 50/50 with Naturals dog food blend.  They are doing great.Sept 2012I love this breed specific food, however I just went to place my next bi-monthly order and I am shocked at the price hike in just over a month!  I paid$41.79 on Aug 3 for a 25lb bag and here it is Sept 20Th and the price has is now $53.94, a difference of $12.15 in price!  This is a huge amount to go up considering that I am assuming this is a price gouge; due to the speculation over crops :( I will look to my local vet for this product. I can get a large bag now less at Petco as well with the discounts they offer. They will order a larger bag if you ask. I grew up on Yunnan tea as a child - it was always my mothers favorite - so I was happy to find an economical source of it of a quality that was great for a \"large volume\" habitual tea drinker like me. This tea is my daily regular tea. Yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time. Its aromatic and flavorful without any additives. If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore. being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer I am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized I looooove pocky, got once at luckys and couldnt stop, its like the chocolate is laced with crack. anywho, the product is good, the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially, but it didnt take too much effort to take apart the sticks.Great product, and great price from this merchant! Everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this.  It is addicting.  That includes our 3 year old. i love them. not too sweet but just right. any allergy free food is great in my book. hope non of these ingredients contains Corn...thats a no no for me too. HOWEVER I DONT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I OPENED MY NEW BOX AND THE CUT 1/4 OF IT OFF. IF THE SIZE IT LESS THEN SO SHOULD THE CHARGE. THIS WILL EFFECT MY DECISION IN BUYING AGAIN. I AM NOT A TODDLER I NEED A REAL SIZE BAR PLEASE With all the allergies in our family, these ended up working out great.  We dont have any negative reactions to the ingredients and though we dont buy many pre packaged foods, these work for on-the-go. Our family tried several varieties and I prefer the Cocoa Loco Bars; theyre almost like a Tootsie Roll to me-though I cant eat Tootsie Rolls, so this is a great substitute for that occasional craving.  My family prefers the Very Berry Bars because they can eat those when they miss breakfast, need a healthy snack, or my son will take them on his cross country running meets.  They are very dense and filling-not a soft bar and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time. Im new to food allergies.  My 6mo son was diagnosed with some severe FA and since hes still breastfed, I had to drastically alter my diet.Before learning about this brand, I was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal.  So when I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods, I was very excited to try it.Overall, I really like them.  Its got pretty good texture, taste and heft.  Its not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box (which really isnt that big).I know alot of people complain about the size/packaging and I agree somewhat.  But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories... on par with many other breakfast bars.  I like the Berry flavor the best, its the closest to real, non FA specialty flavor. Overally, Im grateful for these bars because now I can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when I really need a quick snack, I wont be left stranded. Tasty, convenient bars for people with celiac disease. They seem to have gotten smaller over time, but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size (and the price). This brand of granola bars are really good.  The very berry are my favorite.  However, the bars are almost ridiculously small.  Yeah, were gluten free, so our food is a lot more dense than other food, but honestly, can we not have normal sized, good tasting granola bars?  They really are tiny.  So, the taste is GREAT but the bar is small. My son Loves these \"fruit bars\" they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars.  My suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones... Now my son favors them (chocolate) ones MORE than the berry ones... For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea, Numis Flower Jewel is worth a look. About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and dont get bitter if seeped for long periods.I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list. Numi has a winner here with this tea! My husband, son and I often share this wonderful tea after dinner. It is very pleasant and the reason they love it, it does not turn bitter after longer steeping, like other teas do! My twin 10-month old babies treat this one as dessert.  Their first Earths Best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes.  After water, sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one, followed by apricot puree.  Thats dessert for them right there.  After that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour (not as good as brown rice though).This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly.  Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters.  Add apricot puree and theres really not much one could do to discourage babies after that.  I recommend this flavor brand.Ingredients per label: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency, and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color.Nutrition per label: 80 calories, 15% protein, 90% vitamin A, 2% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 6% iron.This one had the most vitamin A of all Earths Best jars Ive tried.  Ive been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult. Baby loved this one, but as he has progressed I had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if I have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands, it is all over! I think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one. I like the Earths Best baby food line because of the organic ingredients. Amazon has great prices (especially if you subscribe) and free delivery to your doorstop, which is convenient when youre a busy mom. My daughter doesnt like a lot of baby foods, but will eat this one. As other reviewers have stated, its a bit runnier that other EBs stage 2 foods, so I add some oatmeal to it. Its also a bit bland, so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up. As an added bonus, it works wonders for her digestive tract! She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months, sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository, and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber). I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken. I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein. We love earths best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. Ive tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. Its got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family. My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesnt have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus its a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so its a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you dont know a particular babys preferences.Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earths Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems. For whatever reason, our son really likes this flavor. Im not a fan myself, but Im not the one eating it. Any time I can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting, Im a happy mom. My 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this one...by far, it is her favorite jarred baby food. I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and Im not ready to introduce her to meats yet.I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. Thats a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store.  The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earths Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices. Its a good one! I didnt eat any but my baby liked it. She said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in Tuscany. Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you dont recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. Its not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy. Pretty good product.  The taste isnt the best but its definitely not the worse either.  It gives a pretty smooth energetic kick. Sent this basket to my father for his birthday.  He said the fruit was very fresh and sweet.  Happy with this healthy purchase! I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or \"bark\" a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappys extract. I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me. I dont think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee, but they taste far better than instant coffee.  At work, we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser.  This brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee.  I highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but dont have access to a coffee maker.  Individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings. I live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this. Especially when I need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep. Its just like making tea and tastes decent enough. Not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream. I am so convinced these are human animal crackers. They look and taste EXACTLY like human ones (yes, I tasted it) and they contain sugar, which is not one of the last ingredients in the nutrition facts either. So ill just give my dog very small amounts. I have been struggling to find them in the shops nearby.Much more convenient to order them through Amazon (slightly more expensive, but I save the gas and the burden). This is a cute product to use in place of sprinkles - the bright colors of candy coating look great, and the chocolate center keeps them from being overly sweet.However this price is roughly double what you pay at Michaels (or Marshalls, when they stock stuff like this). Plus you can get the same product but in a 16 oz bag on Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/CK-Products-Rainbow-Candy-Coated/dp/B00375LAO0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1300131716&sr=1-1. Comes with Prime shipping too! Love this for espressos...the raw sugar cube is not as sweet as the refined sugars and more rich in flavor. Natures Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.The TestThe neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then theyve been eating it mixed with their Blue food.I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they dont specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls dont mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Rays dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. Wed feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you cant go wrong with Farm Selects. I first had these Uncle Rays chips a few years ago while traveling out west. I tracked them down on Amazon and recognized the name. They are just as good as I remember: smoky sweet with just enough kick, and theres adequate seasoning on all of the chips. Each bag also has a little story, courtesy of Uncle Ray, that usually has some moral message or anecdote. They are pretty funny, but not intentionally. My only problem with these chips is their texture. Theyre a bit thin, and theres not much of a crunchy texture. Otherwise, these are good chips and well worth trying out. I LOVE Old Dutch Ketchup chips but they are no where to be found in the US and pricey on eBay.  I tried Herrs but they were dull - very ketchupy but not the tangy-vinigary ketchup bite that Old Dutch has (makes your mouth hurt  in a good way if you eat too many!).  Uncle Rays are decent - more of a kick - many \"loaded\" chips which I like, still, not the addictive bite I love.  So - if you love Herrs these may be too much for you.  If you love Old Dutch give these a shot.  I am still on my quest for something equal to Old Dutch!! We can rarely find these potato chips where we live, so I decided to find them online to satisfy our cravings. We cannot be happier with the ordering from Amazon! The chips arrived fast and in a box that protected them from crushing. Excellent and will be ordering again! I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits hes gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesnt drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that hes getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I dont like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.) As soon as I opened the teabag envelope, the smell was truly Divine Nasal Candy :-).  As good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled, the tea proved to be rather bitter.  I may have steeped it too long, so will see if the bitterness abates steeping less.  However, as I prefer milk or cream products in flower teas, the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had.  Lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea.  I suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea.  Will definitely reorder. Almost 150 Charms Blow Pops for less the 10 cents each.  These are great for bribing my children and a trip down memory lane. this salsa is definitely one for the books!! A perfect blend of the jolokia pepper and seasonings that made this the perfect dip for half-time.. Grown men crying because its soooo hot is a small price to pay for this awesomeness in a jar... perfect for my cream cheese dip too! A+ across the board. This salsa was delicious. It was very spicy as Im sure youve guessed, but was also pretty dang tasty. It was a bit sweeter than I prefer my salsa and given the price I dont think it is something I would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing, you just might end up loving it! I purchase 2 15 pound bags of 9 Lives Daily Essentials a month for my daughters cats. They love it. She says they often gather around the carton and wait for her to open it. They know whats in there and cant wait for it to be opened. If the cats love it, we love it. Isnt that how it goes? Expensive, but worth it, and Ive tried every Iced tea out there. Lipton is pretty good too, but this is the best!! Tetleys sux, and many other Iced teas like Bigelow are terrible, but this is great! Like the coffee shop These arent diced, its just mush, But I like the no bpa and would buy again for that reason- but dont expect diced. Being the candy-lover that I am, I wanted to buy some cute lollipops that I could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever I felt like it. For that purpose alone, Id give them five stars. However- at first lick, the lollipop has a slightly off taste; but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way. I laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are Made in China- Im not dead/dying/sick. Good enough? As well, the text on the wrapper is fine- I wasnt repulsed by it and Im not afraid to share. Id only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating.The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed- so they do not have that shiny look that many others have. None of mine came broken, and they were well-wrapped. Im happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all(minus the few that I share with friends), but Id try something different next time. Got these as part of a party favor for a rainbow birthday party, so I havent actually tasted them. The lollipops are cute . . . the wrappers have writing on them, which I wish they didnt (would have been much cuter without the writing). They are a bit smaller than I expected (just slightly larger than a regular lollipop), and a few arrived broken, but really, they were well packaged, and looked cute for the party. Anyone who has been on a low carb eating program for any period of time will tell you that it gets boring.  We are new to the Dixie Carb Counters line, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent taste.  Some of the other low carb lines (like Atkins) have a terrible aftertaste, or require the user to have a great imagination. (Yes....this is really supposed to be a chocolate bar.)  But the Dixie Carb items are great.  Easy to make, nice portion size, great taste, and no imagination required.  It really is a muffin!  And...no sugar alcohol!  My only issue is that they are a little pricey.  Otherwise perfect! Im going to guess that Yuck didnt mix it up right, because, frankly, these taste surprisingly good considering theyre supposed to be lo-carb. Theyre easy to make, and the non-diabetic in the house thinks theyre just as tasty as I do. I do agree that the price is pretty outrageous, though. These are actually very tasty.  Pure potatoes with a great texture and no nasty filler \"stuff.\"  No bacon, no cheese...just tasty potatoes.  They cook well in either the oven or microwave.  I add a touch of either salt & pepper or fajita seasoning to spice it up.  I rated 4 out of 5 stars because they could be a bit bigger portion.  However, this item is a fairly good value for the money. They are more potato crockets in the shape of a ball rather than Au Gratin, but nevertheless YUM YUM YUM! I really like this product.  It tasted great and only took a few minutes to make in the microwave. Excellent and tasty though I thought not enough garlic so I added more. When I order GARLIC I guess I expect more of it.  But perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone. Omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers, a premier company, hard to find anymore. We had these along with Omaha prime rib. Both were great. Two where plenty to fill up. Made them in toaster oven in less then 20 minutes. I received 4 of these in my first ever Omaha Steaks order that I received today. I wasnt sure what to expect, but so far, Ive been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so Id say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldnt order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as theyre part of a nicely priced packaged deal, Ill definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldnt order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didnt include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, theres no partially hydrogenated oils, so theres no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but thats obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out theres 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients. January 3, 2011I purchased these potatoes from Omaha Steaks online last week. I was not sure what to expect ... The au gratin potatoes I had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly wasnt it ... I opened the box and got out my skillet. The first thing that I noticed is that these things were huge ... like a gigantic tater tot. I browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. To my surprise, they were very tasty. Texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. I liked them alot. I think these are perfect for kids ... none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture ... I give these 4 stars. I like em but nothing unique about the flavor.  basically saves you from having to make them at home... a little pricey but for a treat what the heck They taste pretty good. I eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from Omaha Steaks. It makes a great meal. Its a great product- especially if you like garlic! No need for \"slicing & dicing! (Which is a good thing when your right side is \"stroke paralized\"!) Just garlic too- not an \"oily & salty product\" Just plain or roasted GARLIC ! And it lasts a long time too! I love this tea. It has a mild flavor and no caffeine. The only problem is that the string comes detached from the bag after about a minute in hot water. This doesnt happen once in a while, it happens nearly every time.Triple Leaf Tea, please fix this bag issue. Its frustrating to the point where I may look for a similar tea from another company. This is an excellent training treat for every day.  Its not a \"high value\" treat (used for more challenging training situations) nor is it so bland that it does not serve as an incentive.  Its a good size, though it does make some crumbs.  Plus, \"liver biscotti\" is fun to say! I DONT MIND PAYING A LOT FOR A QUALITY TREAT FOR MY DOGS AS THESE ARE, BUT I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM IN COMPANIES WHO PRICE GOUGE ON SHIPPING CHARGES.  ITS OBVIOUSLY NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GET THE AMOUNT OF MONEY (WHICH IS HIGH) FOR THE TREATS THEMSELVES THEY HAVE TO ALSO MAKE MONEY OFF ME FOR SHIPPING CHARGES.  THERE IS NO WAY THAT IT COST THEM $10 TO SHIP A 5LB BAG OF TREATS TO ME.  $6 DOLLARS WOULD BE FAIR AND ACCURATE, THIS IS THE REASON I GAVE IT ONLY 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5 After a second purchase of a 12-oz Beer Nuts Peanuts 6-pack, I can level no complaints. The shipment again arrived without any adverse settling such as clumping inside the cans. Although the flavor may be a bit duller than my abiding childhood memory of them, this may be attributable instead to the diminished taste buds of a middle-ager. Nonetheless, everyone I know who has tried this product likes it.  Either as a stand-alone snack or as an adjunct to a couple of beers, Beer Nuts is a tasty, if understated winner. I am 76 years old and I have eaten these nuts for many years.  The ones mailed to me are very tastey.  The only problem is that they were jostled around and a lot of the red skins came off and went to the bottom of the can.  No big deal but it would have been better if they had stayed on the nuts.  I will order from Amazon again. I use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks.  With the high price of cocoa on the commodity market, this is an excellent price, especially for an organic product.  The cocoa is less \"tasty\" than my regular brand, but does very well for the price.  My main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with NO label.  I would like to see an organic label, as well as, the nutrition info for the product. Wow--this was the first licorice Id had in two years after being diagnosed with Celiac disease.  That was one of the hardest things to give up!  These are nice--not exactly like the real thing, but close enough.  There are many companies that call their product \"licorice,\" but they are merely rip-offs of \"Dots\" candy: i.e. nothing like real licorice--very gooey and stick to your teeth.  These are quite firm, more like older licorice, but still a great chew.  It satisfied me and my craving for \"real\" licorice. Gluten Free foods tend to be extremely expensive when compared to \"regular\" foods. This licorice follows that trend. For the times when youd like to treat yourself, Candy Tree Organic Licorice is a tasty and safe treat for Gluten Intolerant people. Amazon seems to have the best prices on it too. I low orange tictacs and after reading reviews I decided to try these and there almost just as good. Orange is still my favorite but cherry is pretty close Since husband quit smoking many many yrs ago, he took up the tic-tac habit with cinnamon tic-tacs.  they no longer make cinnamon so he has tried the wild cherry and they are OK. Spectrum Naturals Walnut Oil, refined, is a very mild oil. I cant detect any walnut smell or taste any walnut flavor at all. Maybe thats what you want in some cases, though I was hoping for a more nutty flavor like raw walnuts.It does have the advantage of having higher Omega 3 content than most oils. Also most oils that are high in Omega 3 (like fish oil and flax oil) have a strong taste which you probably dont want on your salad.Unlike some of Spectrums oils, it is not organic. I bought the NuNaturals White Stevia with Maltodextrin several months ago as Im trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners. The first morning I tried it in my coffee and hated it. It tastes just as bitter as Equal or Sweet n Low. I decided to give it another  try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious. Ive also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea. So, I think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia. All in all Im glad I bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go. I have tried many different brands of stevia but, so far this is the only one I have not thrown out. I also tried Truvia. Not a fan. It makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice! After years of using synthetic sweeteners like Equal and Sweet N Low, I realized their long-term effects and wanted to find a good alternative. NuStevia was a lucky discovery. It has virtually no bitter aftertase, its all natural and Ive been using it exclusively for more than a year now. It works in both hot and cold beverages and comes in bulk and in packets for portability.I havent used it for baking and probably wont because the chemistry of most recipes depends on sugar or something similar to get a good effect. However, for daily use in beverages, this product is very good. NuStevias White Stevia powder is amazing!  I have been on a low-carb diet for the last year and have lost 27 lbs, and NuStevia products were a big help with the success of my diet.  I love sweet things, and without them I dont think Id have been able to stay on the low-carb diet.  I have been unable to eat sugar for a long, long while.  I had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave, but when I discovered they were not on the low-carb diet Id switched to, I had to find something else to use as a substitute.  NuStevia products are what I chose.  I tried several other types of stevia, but NuStevia products seem to be the best so far.  The bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from NuStevia products.NuStevia white stevia powder is super sweet, so youll have to use it sparingly, and one bottle lasts a very long time.Im very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again. These are a cheap alternative for summer when everyone wants a cold treat. Superior flavor and size than the Fla-Vor-Ice case. We first tasted this coffee in the hotel coffee shop in Costa Rica while on vacation.  We bought a few bags and brought them back home with us.  Costa Rica grows arabica coffee beans, fantastic.  We enjoy good coffee and it is best in the morning. Its strong, flavorful, full bodied, and not bitter.  In our 12 cup drip coffee maker, we use two rounded scoops (about 5 tbs).  When we finished the last of the coffee, we looked on Amazon and found the exact brand we had purchased in Costa Rica.  We bought four bags and will be getting more. I used to use this coffee after we visited Costa Rica and gave some to my aunt.  She thinks it is the best coffee there is, so I gave her some for Christmas.  It is excellent. i purchased this item for a cake that called for gold dust, never thought i would find it, but im glad i did. when i sprinkled it on it looked  like a shining star. the container is small but it will go a long way. worth buying. These radiation-treated dinners that dont need freezing are a great convenience.  Ive tried quite a few of the Hormel Compleats and this is one of my favorites.  Home cookin, it aint, and its a bit too salty, but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds, its hard to beat.  The only reason Ive given this flavorful, decently chicken-filled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white.  We all know by now that whole grains are healthier, so, until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice, Ill mark them down. Not so sure about this product. Chicken and Rice is not really what there is. Sure there is some chicken and some rice but mostly gravy. All in all I still like it. A bit dry but still good. They may be perfectly all right; I just thought the noodles were hard and dry.Im still enjoying them. I ordered this 13-pack sampler, and I have to say that I really do like the flavor of the Donut Shop Classics pods.  They are mellow, smooth, and have virtually no bitterness.  I just cant believe how fresh they manage to keep their pods.  I give them four stars because I prefer freshly roasted and ground, but to date, when Im in a hurry in the mornings, which is most mornings, I reach for a pod of Donut Shop Classics. If you like garlic this is for you. Ive been making this as a dip with Greek yogurt and reduced fat mayonnaise. I usually add chopped spinach to it and serve it with crudites and chips. I have gotten rave reviews from my friends. My only complaint is that it consists of dried vegetables and a powder and it is difficult to make sure they are equally distributed when measuring it out. Sure, I could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product. But I dont think I would have found a product as good and tasty as Dr. McDougall. The noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite. I was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a Thai food restaurant. Overall, Im pleased with my order and the quality of the product. These are super tastey! I would definitely recommend. The only reason Im not giving 5 stars is because I wish they were bigger! :D This product is very good.  It goes a long way.  But quite as good as the one at DD.  Good product not the less. I absolutely LOVE the just tomatoes tomatoe slices. I thought the bits might be good for soups etc., but they dont seem to have the same sweet flavor of the slices. I will ues these up, but go back to the slices. On the whole, a great product. I am enjoying this coffee but the vanilla is a little overpowering.  The strength of the coffee itself is very good.  I can use one packet to make 2- 4 oz. cups with the Senseo coffee maker so it definitely saves me money.  Plus, it is just so easy to make coffee and clean up in the morning! This was my first time purhcasing muffin mix as well as baking muffins.  To me the muffins came out a little dry, but tasted great and the people I shared them with said they were good too.  I will, more than likely, purchase Marth White Muffin Mix in the future.  The muffin mix came at an excellent price and I cant complain.Thank you Amazon.com for having most everything under the sun for sale. Good product and decent shipping. However, the price was $15.95 and I later found the same item in a local store for $6.95. What a gouge. The Taste of Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are really yummy! The coconut and ginger flavors are very mild.Each recloseable, Chinese-takeout-shaped box conveniently serves as a microwaveable container. One box makes enough for me to have 2 very filling lunches or for my whole family to share as a side dish. (The kids always lunge at the opportunity to have these!)The only negative thing I can say is that I wish there werent so many separate little seasoning packets to mix in (3, plus the noodles); a single combined spice packet would be easier. (Of course, one benefit of multiple packets is the ability to leave out a certain spice if youre not fond of it, but I like them all!) Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor).While some people have remarked on the \"over-sized\" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage.While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual \"taste of THAI.\" Id recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal-Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety. At least not at the store near me.If you havent tried this brand of instant noodles yet, I think youll be in for a treat. Its very tasty and very easy to make.  If youre in need of a very quick, filling meal and it needs to be gluten free, this works out great.  Try the Thai Peanut one, too. Very tasty gluten-free option.  My kids loved it as it wasnt too spicy. The Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are quick and easy to prepare. You will be rewarded with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle enjoyer. Used to use another brand (that changed), in a jar, but this is so much better! Has a very pleasing hot spicy taste with a hint of lemon/lime and a good amount of heat. It is a little too salty though, if you like to use a fair amount to \"spice it up\". We wish it had a lower sodium content. While, made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better; this is the next best thing! Really good with chicken, beef, pork, tofu and veggie dishes. Quick and easy to make good-for-you meals. We dont like the packaging and wish it were in a jar, but other than that and the sodium content, we like it. Will buy again! I purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients. No doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. But I realized this doesnt have DHA that helps to develop cognitive brain function. Also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. So I believe its a great food for an adult dog, but I wouldnt recommend it for a puppy. I really liked these chips as did my entire family. I wish you could pick and choose the flavors in the variety pack. I would love to try the sweet potato and chili lime and leave the salt and pepper behind. I like these Pop Chips a lot, but not all the flavors.  This variety pack makes a good sampler of the various flavors and then you can purchase the flavors you like.  These chips have strong flavor and are not greasy.  They are fairly filling and make a great snack.  Theyre pretty noisy (like most chips) so dont take em to the local theater!These came well packed and they are in stay fresh packaging.  I can attest that they do keep well for a pretty long time as I found a bag that had gotten pushed behind some other things, and after several months it still tasted fine.  ;)These are a pretty good size for a quick snack.  Quality has been consistent over several different batches.  I really like the texture and crunch, and love the lack of greasiness. Good flavorful chips - too bad the selection does not include jalape&ntilde;o or paramsan garlic. Packaging is difficult to open, but they fresh. For all of you potato chips lovers who are trying to eat healthy, these chips are a great alternative!  No they are not like fried, but the flavor along with the calorie/fat benefits make this a great choice! I liked having the variety pack for the opportunity to see which flavors I would like. As it turns out, I like them all! But I do have my favorites (like BBQ, salt & vinegar, and plain) so being able to buy them singlularly is an added plus.  I have already placed two orders since my initial purchase! I like all the varieties except the salt and pepper.  They taste too much like black pepper and nothing else.  The others are very goodl<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO\">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> The PopChips were great and they were fresh when they arrived. For the price, I wish there were more bags of chips for my bucks. The product is exactly what it is portrayed to be. Tasty (not yummy) but good. I received the product promptly. I ordered 2 cases and will eat every package. Im a crunchaholic! I have to have something during the day to crunch! All other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. PopChips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too! I highly recommend them all, but the salt and pepper are my least favorite! I bought the 6-flavor variety pack.  They are pretty good... nice thing is that Im not 100% sure if Im crazy about the texture so by the end of an 0.8 oz bag I dont really want anymore.  However in my quest for different snack foods I found the \"Food Should Taste Good\" line of cracker chips.  My money will be spent on those rather than pop chips.  However I think that people should give these a try as well. The original flavor would work fine with any dip and are okay on their ownThe salt and pepper flavor is AWESOME.  Really tasty and a great snack for only 100 caloriesThe sour cream and onion is a little chemicall-y but decent.The barbeque is good but not tasty enough.  The flavor doesnt go as well with the texture.Havent yet tried the other two flavors.  Will update as I do.If you havent tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes.  Less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fat.So far I have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active.  These definitely beat a 150 - 300 calorie bag of potato chips as a snack. I tried these in Colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast. Amazon didnt sell the ones I wanted. I put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one. Within a week of their birthday, Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but, took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad, Amazon usually comes through. I really like the flavors and the fact that the chips are low in fat.  I especially like the bbq and salt and vinegar.  I dont care for the salt and pepper.  I wish I could get a multipack and choose the flavors I want. Good Variety of the flavors, makes it helpful to sample for your choice of type you prefer. Also good for packed lunches or as a portioned snack. I found these chips on vacation in Oregon.  The store was a kind of natural yet upscale type of grocery store.  I had never seen them before.  They are different than regular chips-no oily taste but very flavorful.  I didnt know if I could get them in CA so I ordered a case! These are great little snack packs - flavorful chips and fairly low fat and low cal. I tried this chips in a hotel that I stayed at, and loved them! I ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them. Im on my second order! Although I can not say that these are the same thing as potato chips, they are a good alternative and very tasty. The flavors are much like the potato chips you would get at the store; it is the texture that is different. They are less oil (a good thing) and lighter than potato chips almost like a rice cake except much thinner and crisper. All of the flavors are good except for the cheese one. I didnt care for it although my two-year-old likes it.All-in-all, for the calories, you cant beat it, and for long term weight maintenance and health, these are great and delicious as well. Amazon.com sends out a very fresh product that is as good as if you bought it from the shelf of your local grocery store. Like many others, we were on the fence about buying these Popchips, with the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips that even the dogs may not eat.  Turns out though we enjoy them all, the kids like the plain ones, saying they taste like Pringles, and my wife and I are particularly fond of the cracked pepper and salt.  We are not fans of BBQ chips in general, but still ate the BBQ Popchips.I will definitely be buying these again Possibly THE best salt and vinegar chips (healthy or not) ever!  The salt is just right and compliment the vinegars tartness perfectly.All the chips are good.. salt and pepper can be a little overwhelming. If you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. Suprisingly, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer. Very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact, the taste is better than most regular chips Ive had. Would highly recommend this product! This is a really nice product. Popchips dont taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options.  They are light in taste and big on crunch.  Great alternative to potato chips.  Im not a fan of the BBQ flavor but I do like the sea salt & vinegar, salt & pepper alot and sour cream and onion.  Like the individual bags - perfect for on the go and lunches. Pop-Chips are VERY GOOD!  Im on a mission to lose weight and these have replaced high calorie snacks.  I think I even like these better than regular chips!  The BBQ, Salt & Vinegar, and Cheddar are really good alone (and Im not normally a BBQ chip person).  I tend to eat the Original, Sour Cream & Onion , and the Salt & Pepper with Laughing Cow Cheese as a dip.  I dont really care for the salt & pepper as much as the others because I dont really like pepper in general and these are very peppery.  I wish they would replace the salt & pepper with the parmesan garlic flavor.Also, I like to buy these small packages to limit my portion size, but also because there are a lot of chips in this one little bag.  It also makes it really convenient for me to grab a few bags and take them to work or throw a few in the car.  I dont have kids but the small bags would be nice for kids as well. They were not bad tasting...........they served the purpose that I wantned with a sandwich nice and crunchy I love popchips, The bag now has only 100 calories. and it bit smaller but If you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great. These are for you. A bit pricey but worth it. This chips are perfect for a snack without having greasy fingers leftover.  All the flavors are great with my favorite being the vinegar and sea salt. I first got the variety pack to try all the different flavors, then I picked 2 and ordered them on Subscribe and Save (1 each on alternate months).  Its much cheaper than the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you.  These chips are crisp, delicious, and taste salty, mmmmmmm good! Each bag has 230 mg. of sodium. They only have 100 calories in a bag, and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving, unlike other 100 calorie snacks where you get 7 almonds, or 5 crackers....  Now I can have chips every day at work for lunch, no guilt!  The Salt and Pepper variety is absolutely delicious.  The plain is great for dipping, and the barbecue is full of flavor.  The salt and vinegar is very sour, if you like that type, and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good, just not my favorites.  A very good deal on Subscribe and Save, chips delivered to your door, individually bagged and ready to take for lunch.  Convenient!  Nothing bad to say about PopChips! The Sun Chips are an OK substitute for the usual potato, corn, whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted.  They are not nearly as un-palatable as I thought they would be.  Have added them to my heart healthy diet regime.  All are good except for the multi-grain style, which has the texture of a sheet of plywood. The cheddar tastes a little weird, but that could be personal preference. The salt and vinegar is very strong, but tastes okay other than that.  Salt and pepper is yum!  Barbeque is good too.  Plain is plain.  If youre a die hard potato chip lover and dont care about calories, dont bother with these.  However, if you want your salty snacks and dont want all the calories, these work.  Id buy them again. Love these!  Im not a fan of potato chips but these taste fresh and not at all greasy.  A little like Pringles but much tastier. I wont get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on Amazon. However, I will talk about the product overall. It is very well packaged, the PopChips bags arent flimsy or too loud. You dont have to worry much about these getting smashed while theyre in a bag with heavier items. They hold their own. When trying new foods, snacks, flavors, I tend to purchase a variety pack so that I can sample everything. Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, its not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you dont like those flavors, I would say you wouldnt like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a \"diet\" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being \"too salty\" or \"high in sodium\". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesnt consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is. We liked these.  Quite good, even if theyre healthy @ 100 calories & 3 whole fat grams a bag. My favorites are the plain, the others are very strong flavored, very zippy! I really like these chips.  They have a different texture than regular potato chips but I still find it really tasty.  Even my boyfriend, who is often averse to all things \"healthy\" and \"low fat\" will gobble these up rather quickly.  The variety packs are great because they allow you to have a little bit of everything, but of course the downside is that you may not like some flavors as much.  I find the original version to be a little bland by itself, and the sea salt and vinegar flavor might be too strong for some people. Overall the chips were very tastey. My pickey daughter even liked then so that is a real plus for me. Some flavors were better but all did meet my expectations. Try it and see for yourelf, Enjoy. Love pop chips! The assortment package was a great find but would liked to be able to choose the flavor varieties I  wanted. Did not care for the sea salt and vinegar flavor but all the rest were great! I loved this product, and it was better than what I thought it was going to be. My favorite was teh salt and vinger flavor (yum yum) but I hated the cheddar, and salt & pepper ones. I am not going to lie. I will give you the strait dope. These things are like crack.I will polish off about 4-5 pages of these EASILY in a day (hence the freshman 50! that I have gained!) lol.If you love these, I suggest balancing them out with some kind of carb blocker. I won them off a penny auction site. My 2 year old likes them plenty. I dont think there is any potato flavor, they taste more like ricecakes to me, but are ok. The salt and vinegar is strong holy cow!! I do love PopChips. They work well with weight watchers, taste great and the crunch cant be beat. This pack has many flavors, with the salt and vinegar being my favorite, my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar.The one I miss is Sweet Potato. It is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors, but arent included in this variety pack. I bought these to try them out and for the most part it was a success. There are 6 different flavors of chips. 5 of them were really good. The last one though was not. The salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes. Maybe some people like it but not us. All in all though, they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric content.I would definitely buy a box with the flavors that I wanted. This practically falls under the category of healthy snack - well, almost.  Single serving bags mean you wont be overeating and the fact that these arent in anyway greasy because of the way they are made is a huge plus.  Nice crisp crunch.  The bags are filled with air, which for the most part do a good job of keeping the chips whole.  On the case that I got, though, two bags containted nothing but broken bits.  Of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips - some no broken ones at all.  I also noticed that you dont find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as Ive experienced when eating other chips.Purchasing it by the case to try out all of the flavors is a good idea and a decent value.  Some of the flavors are incredibly strong, to the point that I dont like them, so I wont be ordering this mixed case again.  Salt and Pepper just tasted like pepper, making this a very hot tasting chip.  The Seasalt and Vinegar is really strong on the Vinegar, which is a taste I dont enjoy.  I love BBQ flavored chips, but again, this was kind of strong.  I probably wouldnt purchase the BBQ ones in the future, but wouldnt say no if someone offered them to me.  The Original is really bland compared to these others, but not bad.The ones I liked the most were the Sour Cream & Onion and the Cheddar, both with milder flavors.Id give this 5 stars if I liked all of the flavors.  Definitely high marks for the type of chip and the size of the serving and the fact that you can try all of the flavors in one order. Im a big fan of the Dirty Martini - but I simply cant eat enough olives to keep up!Love this stuff - Not quite as tangy as Dirty Sue, but still very vibrant. the last case (a different brand)we ordered from Amazon was so terrible we threw away the entire case.  However, the Boscoli brand is very good and we can enjoy a good dirty martini. This product is great if you want a dirty martini, I highly recommend this product and it saves you from buying olives and wasting just to get the brine. i like it and i find the grinder bottle to be very convenient. i like the taste of it and i would definitely buy it again, and considering its healthy use for sure. I am a BzzAgent and I recently received a package of these to try.  I have to say that I absolutely LOVE the flavor of these candies.  I am usually not a big candy eater, but I have to say that I was really impressed.  The Werthers Chewy Caramels were so richly flavored and chewy that I couldnt stop at just one (I usually stop at one for most other candies).  They have a great buttery flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  I like the fact that they have some great ingredients, like cream and butter, but I had to deduct one star for the fact that there are artificial flavors in them (I am an avid label reader and try to stay away from any artificial ingredients).  As far as the taste goes, my kids and my husband were constantly in the pantry looking to grab another candy, so I can confidently say these were a huge hit in our family.  It was also a great incentive for the kids to eat their vegetables at dinner- they certainly cleaned their plate to have a couple of caramels for dessert.  If you are having a party, these would be great set out in a candy dish.  There will be none left by the end! I reviewed Werthers original chewy caramels, caramel chocolates, and creamy filledhard caramels as a BzzAgent and found the chewy caramels came a close second to theoriginal hard candies.  Still has that great unique caramel flavor from Werthers butnow in a chewable form.  I prefer the original hard candy as those little gems lasta little longer but these are a nice second choice. This is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one I use. A bit pricy but if you dont mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle. Combine this with a Waring Waffle maker and you could be in Waffle Heaven. I was expecting great things based on the reviews. While it IS good, its not great. I believe my waffles made from Bisquick were just as tasty as these, and this costs quite a bit more. The instructions ARE very easy to follow though, and I DO like the canister for storage. I love this pancake mix.  I bought my first can from Whole Foods Market about a year ago.  My only complaint is, for all the work you have to put into making them (at least the pancakes anyway) you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch.  You have to add your own egg, whole milk, and melted butter.  One thing I have noticed about this mix is that its relatively difficult to burn the pancakes.  It is, however, easy to overcook them. This is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make. Let me start by saying my family loves this stuff.  It has a fairly strong flavor of vanilla.  It cooks up nicce and light.  My problem with this product is the recent price increase.  It was a good product at a fair price but now it is pricey.  All-in-all I would suggest that you order this at least once to taste what good pancakes are supposed to taste like.  After that I would suggest playing with recepies on your own. This is the pancake mix we go to when we dont have buttermilk in the fridge (dont think the vinegar trick is worth it so we always do fresh) to make Alton Browns buttermilk pancake recipe.  This Stonewall mix is a good option and the flavor is the best of any store bought mix by far! It might cost more, but it really is superior to the other prepared mixes. I got this as a gift and liked the flavor but I wasnt crazy about the texture.  I like fluffy pancakes and believe it or not, imo, Aunt Jemimas buttermilk ready mix is the best one out there and its so easy to make.Of course, the best tasting waffles are made by me from scratch with buttermilk and all.=)Overall, I think buying gourmet pancake mix is one of the biggest waste of money.  And it still requires you to put melted butter, milk, etc.I am sticking with my own recipes and Aunt Jemimas if I am in a hurry. The entire family loved this pancake mix. It was easy to make and tasted great. We tried it with syrup, powdered sugar, as well as fresh strawberries and apple compote. I would definately purchase this again. The only problem is my family wants this every weekend and I have to double to feed my large family. It gets expensive quickly, so I do not order it as often as they would like. I have had waffles from other mixes that are too sweet.  I have also made them from scratch.I like my waffles with NO Sugar in them, because I dont like too much sugar.  This mix is very good.  Waffles are just the right consitancy for me and the mix is easy to prepare. This lands in the gormet category for sure.  Having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home.  The price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to downgrade the product bnecause of that.They cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time. Im not normally a big fan of mixes but this is a great waffle mix.  Its quick, easy, and produces delicious waffles.  Yes, its pricier than some of the other mixes on Amazon but I think its worth it. The pancakes were delicious, but they werent as fluffy as the ones I normally make.  Next time I use this, Im going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps. On a whim, I picked up a two-pack of Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix recently, enticed in some measure by the already positive reviews here--and I will add to those by noting that we will be keeping a supply on hand in our pantry.I really did not expect that this easy-to-prepare mix would yield waffles better than the from-scratch recipes I had been using, but now the waffle iron is stashed within easy reach after being banished to the recesses of the cabinets for the last few years.Being able to whip out crisp, airy, light, malty waffles does wonders for ones popularity in the kitchen, and pairing these with real maple syrup and fresh blueberries is the way to go. No matter how you mess up the recipe, this Mix still makes my family happy in the Sunday morning :) Heavily touted by the reviews, decided to try.  Mix is good, but not great.  Probably wouldnt buy again. As a new Keurig owner, Im trying as many \"sampler\" packs as possible to determine what both my husband and I like the most.Although quite pricey and not coming in the cute gift box some other \"Crazy Cups\" purchases have been received in, I am enjoying this variety thoroughly.  It is almost entirely iced drinks and this sampler pack had a good mix of the following:Southern Sweet Tea, Unsweetened Black Tea, Raspberry Sweet Tea, Peach Sweet Tea, Sweet Lemon Tea, Half & Half Tea and a few different iced coffee k-cups.  Additionally, there were a few seasonal Island Coconut which my husband loves.I would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of k-cups, but at a price of over 90 cents a cup I cant justify the cost.  However, this is a good starting point to narrow down some favorites to purchase in single flavor boxes!If these were presented in the gift boxes they use for other samplers, this would be a very ideal gift/house warming present for these hot summer months!  I dont mind them not being in a gift box, but I could have at least used that as an excuse to myself for the price. very good price and we love our keurig trying the summer flavors are great and will probably order more before the end of the summer. I havent had a chance to try these out yet, but I thought I would go ahead and mention that I received 5 each of the following 7 flavors:- Sweet Rasberry Black Iced Tea- Southern Sweet Iced Tea- Sweet Lemon Iced Tea- French Vanilla Iced Coffee- Nantucket Blend Iced Coffee- Gingerbread Coffee- Eggnog CoffeeFortunately Im okay with this, as I was wondering how the Gingerbread and Eggnog tasted as well. You might feel differently though, and might want to know since this seems to be the only variety pack of iced k-cups. There are some types I really like--especially Southern Sweet Tea (which is actually a lot less sweet than Southerners really make it).  The raspberry and peach are also good, and not overly sweet.  Urologist has banned artificial sweeteners from me as they do kidney damage.I did not care for the herbals, and thought there was a bit too much green tea in the assortment--but I found friends who like those flavors.It was to taste test, and it was fine for that.  I dont think I will buy assortments again, as I have found what I really like. I got this on a special and we are coffee lovers and like to try different kinds although Yuban is our everyday coffee. Well this was a surprise! Nice and flavorful, not bitter, smooth and maybe not as strong as Yuban in the same amounts the was all there. If they start selling this in lagers amounts for a better everyday price I would buy more but as is its very pricey. This is an excellent product for the non-gluten diet.  Theyre good alone as a snack, or you can make a light meal with them by using these rice crackers as a base for spreads or little crispy sandwiches.  Excellent substitute for crackers containing gluten.  Only criticism - wish the price would come down. Not as good as Sesmark Savory Rice Minis, but these are available at least. They are VERY good. More healthy than potato chips and a bigger crunch. Mmmmmmmm . . . This freeze dried ice cream is great! It tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package, for a fraction of the price. After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the \"astronaut\" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream. So be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product. My 1 year old son does really like these- andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks.  The only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in, so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go. My dog thinks he was born into the gentry and is entitled to fine dining each evening.  Accordingly, he will not eat plain kibble.  A scoop of this on his dry food, a little water to make gravy and were good to go.  Ordering a case from Amazon was way easier than picking up individual cans at the pet store, too.  All in all, a success for us. Watch out for the fat-- 9g of fat per 17g serving.I guess I knew that nuts have high fat but somehow I was stuck on the \"100 Calories...\"The flavor of these is delicious.

Finally I decided to see if Amazon had it and they did and I bought two boxes.  As long as they make it I will buy it. I love this TEA. It has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea. I do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but I can live with that. No big deal! The quality of TEA makes up for that. I found this exact same stuff at the dollar store.  It is pretty good.  Not as good or as strong as my loose whole leaf tea, but for the price it cant be beat. Bags are never as good as loose leaf.  I use it if I want one quick cup.  I steep my loose leaf tea 2-3 times, so I have to have time to drink 2-3 cups.  I gave this 4 stars because it is a good deal for the money purchased from the dollar store. If I make myself a mug, and because it is cheap, I use 2 bags.  I would have been disappointed if I had paid the original price on here for it though. I got tired of overpaying for tea at Teavana so decided to try this brand of Oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised. It has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer, I just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags. You just cant beat the value of this tea! Using the entire sauce packet is over kill, leaving a salty greasy puddle at the bottom of the carton. Otherwise noodles are well made, and sauce is reasonably well flavored. Quick and easy, a no brainer. This is pretty good stuff. You cant expect a whole lot from instant box-o-noodles, but this is the best out of all the other brands Ive tried before. The noodles have good constancy and the peanut sauce is really tasty as well. Im going to buy more. \"It tastes better than it looks\" was the first thing I said the a skeptical co-worker looking at my peanut satay as it came out of the microwave.  Unfortunately, its as fattening as it looks, so I likely wont be purchasing it often.  I could see this mixing with chicken or beef and tasting even better though! while its not traditional satay  it is very good the oil is ok cause without it it would be too dry, i had some of these that were a year and a half old i made it and it was fine, i will buy again I adore this brand of peanut satay noodles.  Unlike the other ethnic-foods-in-box, Ka-Mes noodles and sauces are flavorful and delicious.  However, theres certainly a downside.  This dish is greasy, fattening, and high in calories.  If you read the nutritional information, youll find that this tiny box contains two servings that are high in fat and not very filling.My advice?  Split this dish with a friend and serve with a small serving of rice.  The sauce is flavorful and potent enough that it bleeds into the rice.  An instant and tasty multi-dish meal! A nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and I enjoy trying them. One is a variety of Baxters soups from Canada. Today, I had the Butternut Squash and Red Pepper Soup. Quite good. Smooth and mellow. Mild taste, but delicious. Goes down real easy and it only comes to 90 calories per serving (2 servings per can). Alas, the sodium content is a bit higher than I like. Otherwise, very good.Gary Peterson Only Pom.Mol.Ive ever used but this seemed to have the same flavor the Chef came up with for a pomegranate relish for fish. It seems to have a bit of a brown appearance though where the one the Chef used was a brighter red color. This was a very good puchase. The shipper was very fast and very friendly. The Tahini was very fresh and of good quality. I will order again. We purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born.  They make a very nice announcement of the new arrival.  They are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum. I discovered these wonderful tomatoes and yes, they are worth paying for. Unfortunately in my area they are approaching 6 bucks a can and never go on sale. Walmart has them for about 4 dollars a can, but I prefer not to be tied down to that store. The local \"Italian mart\" advertised san marzano tomatoes, 4 cans for 5 dollars- too good to  be true? yes, in fact , these are very ordinary tomatoes. I am on the hunt for these wonderful tomatoes at a good price.They turn an ordinary recipe into a gourmet experience. I received my order with a few problems. The majority of the cans arrived dented, some very severely! Amazon needs to add better packing material to keep the cans from moving around in the shipping box, I am surprised they havent fixed this shipping issue by now because of all the complaints here in the reviews. However, Amazon is really great when it comes to problems like this with food items...they are shipping me a new order, no charge, and I get to keep my original order! I am hoping my new order arrives in better condition! These San Marzano Tomatoes are not \"DOP Certified\"! Even though the description says they are? Many people have complained about this in the reviews so I am surprised Amazon is still listing them as \"DOP Certified\"? However, they are very good quality tomatoes and Certified Organic. I have also noticed the price of this item fluctuates often so heres a tip...place it in your shopping cart and then save it for later, check your cart daily and wait for the price to drop! I paid $20.79 but I have seen the price as high as $53.00, so it pays to be patient. Good luck! most if not all of the cans were dented in some way, however it is a cheaper method of purchasing this product I have read past reviews where people complained about receiving dented cans with this product. I had a previous shipment where all was well, but not this time. The shipment came in a badly mangled box, but I thought all would be well when the interior box was pristine. I was very surprised to find a badly dented can in an undamaged box. This tells me that the can was already dented when packed. Amazon should reconsider their source for this product--the tomatoes are superior but the packing stinks. Although I had some concerns about product with initial shipment - my concerns were far overshadowed by the excellent, prompt and courteous response from vendor about my concerns.  Customer service that seems a rarity these days - was absolutely exceptional!  Will definitely keep this vendor in mind when I have need for other craft supplies/products. The M&M candy machine works just fine but the finger hole is too small for adult fingers to retrieve the candy. It does intimidate a M&M lover because of the small amount it dispenses. Im on my first jar of this, and am really enjoying what it adds to my \"concoctions\" - vegetarian one pan mix ups of onions, garlic, vegetables, usually tofu, rice or pasta or quinoa, sometimes olives or capers.I may have purchased it at Uwajimaya, when on sale...I will be buying many more jars of this mixed spice paste.  Its not really a paste - more liquid, with easily identifiable basil leaves.  I highly recommend this chili paste. My husband LOVES pudding and any kind of dessert at the end of dinner. This is a great way to appease his cravings while not being full of butter and fat. I love that I can add whatever I want to it to fancy it up a little. I love to put cocoa powder and make a more elegant tasting chocolate pudding or mix it with berries for my kids. i always enjoy Jello pudding, however, one package that i recieved was opened, and the powder spilled all over.  it really alters the price when you only recieve 23 packages instead of the promised 24. I generally like vitalicious products. The corn muffin, well, for 100 calories its not bad. But if you are expecting anything like the sugar/fat laden junk that your local bakery sells, look elsewhere. this is like a healthy makeover that doesnt quite cut it, but theyre not bad. For the same amount of calories, the chocolate one is more of an indulgence, but this one is good for a bland breakfast treat, especially baked fresh.My kids are happy to get any extra snacks, so they approve...i send with them to school for a midmorning snack. im glad they get fuel and vitamins. I have read a couple of the studies on the anti-inflammatory potential of tart cherry juice, and became convinced that its worth a try (as a 57-YO athlete).  I like this product b/c the label tells exactly how many cherries a tablespoon is equivalent to, so I can make an informed choices as to how much I use, based on the number-of-cherry equivalents in the studies Ive read.  I cant vouch for the accuracy of the label, but Ive no reason to doubt it.  Ive grown to like the flavor, especially mixed with lime seltzer! Tastes like drinking a cherry pie. I purchased this for my mothers gout and she told me it works quickly. Its also supposed to help lower blood pressure. Speedy delivery. Its not 5 stars because of the high price. Good, and reasonable for drink. A product that is good for sleeping and inflamation. I will buy again if the price stays reasonable. This is very good but I prefer the liquid cherry juice.  Less messy to deal with and the concentrate doesnt seem to go as far as the liquid juice.  Just my preference. Sweetarts evokes nostalgic memories of going into the candy store and pining for that sweet and sour chalky taste of this classic candy.  While its a hard candy it is easily chewable and has pleasant texture and taste.  You really cant go wrong with this candy.  The only drawback is it is hard to stop at just one and before you know it youve eaten an entire roll. My dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy. She specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula. Unfortunately, my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy. I tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better. Ive heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesnt consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesnt have the artificial flavoring in it. But Id rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste. If your dog eats slowly & actually chews his food, then this food is fantastic!  We have 2 dogs, 1 that is a picky eater, so we added water and microwave his food for 30 sec.  He loves his dinner & keeps It down. ( full disclosure, hes not the dog with stomach problems.  Our Boston Terrier, who we adopted from a puppy mill situation, eats by gulping down her food, from her years when she had to fight for food.  She is the dog we were targeting by getting sensitive stomach food; she was having a problem with vomiting & regurgitation.  The good news is, if we get her to eat 2-3 small meals a day and try to get her to slow down, problem solved.  Yet, if she eats fastly, without chewing, regurgitation is still a problem.I gave the food 4 stars because. If we do make sure she chews it ( by feeding her a couple morsels at a time, like giving treats) the food stays down, therefore working for vomiting, which was a huge proplem! (she was vomiting 6-9 times a day.) since switching she has stopped vomiting. I dont think our dog is the only one that eats fast, and it does take much longer to feed her. My husband does not like whole wheat anything but he liked this pizza dough. It was very simple to make and spread on our pizza stone. We put Rossi Pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese on and it was great! Its hard to find this stuff locally. Usually my parents have to bring it to me when they visit. Was pleased to find it on Amazon.Makes GREAT, TASTY dhall. We eat a lot of it, so its nice to know I can get it here again when I need it. finally some new varieties of tassimo ... I drink everything from DD to starbucks to nespresso to good blends from fairway .. this one is pretty much right on with the description - dark brew good medium body - it has a strong flavor but is smooth and no aftertaste at all, reminiscent of how sbux does brew their beans (but I like this better than the sbux house coffee..its not quite as edgy), and is unlike many of the other gevalia coffees for Tassimo that I just dont like b/c of their aftertaste (bitter, to me) .. this one brews at 190 degrees (at least mine did), which is a bit hotter than I would make a cup of latte for example (at 160) so be careful on that first sip!  but I do think this ones a keeper... it tastes pretty decent but I wasnt aware how pricy they were when I bought them.  I paid $17.44 for a pack of 12!!!  What a rip off! My husband is gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive, and diabetic, so it is very difficult to find desserts for him.  Usually, if its gluten free, it has waaaay too much sugar, for example.  I tried a box of these cookies for him.  He tried them and said that they are surprisingly good.They are not mereingues, even though they are shaped like those types of cookies.  They are regular cookie consistency.  There are just a few in a package, so they are rather expensive.  However, they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail.  (Can you tell I have made some bombs in my time as a specialty cook? LOL) Whole grain ingredients and good tasting.  Most Kashi products have mostly white flour with very little whole grains, but these cookies are primarily a whole grain mix. Its nice to have a treat that is more nutritious and still sweet enough for my sweet tooth!  There are several varieties of Kashi cookies, and they are all good. YES, these are wonderful and healthy cookies, but this is a rare bad deal from Amazon (really DAB Nutrition)- they are charging about $25 (including shipping).  In less than a minute of web searching I found the same quantity for about $15 shipped.  Enjoy the cookies, but buy from someone else until the price comes down. Yummy. Good flavor. I wish they were softer and not so crumbly......and for some odd reason they give me heartburn, and I never get heartburn. I still like the flavor. I agree with the other positive reviews I see here.  Nice flavor, strong-ish, no bitter, grind-y or conference coffee flavors to mess it up.For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.My favorite k-cups are:Starbucks French RoastStarbucks Caffe VeronaStarbucks Pike Place RoastGreen Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran ReserveGreen Mountain Double Black DiamondGreen Mountain RevvGreen Mountain Dark MagicOther k-cups Ive tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold This coffee has a good flavor and a good strength.  At first it seemed strong but then I got use to it.  I recommend this flavor coffee. Good wake up in the morning. Very nice, smooth cup of coffee.  Caribou Coffee has been a favorite of mine since the first time I visited Minnesota and had the opportunity to go to a store and have coffee.  I have since done mail order for their coffee and after purchasing a Keurig coffee machine was happy to see it was available in K-cups.  I also enjoy the Caribou Blend but I have to say this blend has a little more \"kick\" to it but still a smooth coffee with no after taste. Although Ive only been able to try three of Caribous k cup blends (Mahogany as well as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G\">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPLI\">Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>), Ive found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups.  They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.I should mention that Caribous Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so Ive been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  Its quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isnt normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but its a bit too potent for me.I think this is the best dark roast Ive had the chance to try. Nice bold taste but with a little \"packaged\" overtone.  Like other K-cup products this is just a shade below fresh. I enjoyed this because of the full taste I get out of it without it being too bold or having a burnt taste.  To me it is a bit above the medium blend.  I do take creamer with my coffee so the boldness may be tamed down. I will definitely order more of this when Im am out. Ive sampled many different k-cup coffe types. I prefer a really robust coffee and Carbou mahogany really dosnt provide that. I would cassify it as medium roast coffee with a smooth melow taste. If that is what u are after , then give this blend a try. No bitterness.  A strong, full-bodied, cup but does not taste like ashes.  Smooth, very drinkable.  If you like bold, dark coffee, this will please. My husband enjoyed this coffee. We usually use Newmans Extra Bold but thought wewould try something different. It was a bit too strong for me; I prefer Newmans. But it wasstill good. I like strong coffee, but I dont want it to taste burnt or have an acidic after taste. Caribou Coffees Mahogany is full bodied with a nice balance of dark notes and acidity.  Its one of my \"go to\" coffees when my favorites like Coffee Peoples Wake Up Call are out of stock. I like my coffee strong. This is the first brand that I have tasted that provides the kick I need without the bitterness. I keep my pantry stocked with Mahogony and I do not share! This coffee is very smooth but rather flat compared to Starbucks brews.  It doesnt have any bite to it.If you like a mild coffee, you will enjoy this one. I started drinking coconut water when it was suggested to me by a friend.  I never really loved the taste of it, but I spend a great deal of time in the desert and I just cant seem to suck down enough water without getting waterlogged, so I was excited when I found flavors.  I know that recently its become trendy and much harder for me to find, but my friends have been drinking it for years, as has my yoga instructor, and they highly recommend it for drinking not only for sports, but also to keep hydrated.  Plus, its done wonders for my always dry skin.If nothing else its a great avoid a hangover cure if drunk before going to bed, and if your partied too much to avoid being sick it seems to work much better than Pedialyte to get your electrolytes back in balance. ...Then O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is the drink for you.  I found this drink to be almost overpoweringly sweet as a standalone beverage.  According to the package, O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE contains natural coconut water, natural pineapple juice, cane juice, vitamin C, and natural fruit flavor.  Personally, with the coconut and the pineapple, I think they could have left out the sugar cane.However, when I paired O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE with a light snack of cheese and crackers, it became a very tasty, refreshing drink.  I, apparently, needed a little salt and/or savory to make O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE completely palatable.  With the afore mentioned snack, the O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is really delightful.  I can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today (not so much with the cold winter weather).O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE comes in a handy 8.5 oz box with a place to punch a straw through.  This type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids.  Just throw it in your bag and go.Prior to this experience, I had not heard of coconut water.  On the packaging it says \"O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is a blend of the natural water from inside a young, green coconut and sweet, golden pineapple juice. It has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.\"  Huh...who knew you could drink a green coconut?  Educational and a good source of potassium.  Being allergic to bananas, it is always good to have another source.Overall, I would not drink O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE by itself in the middle of winter.  But together with non-sugary snack or in the high heat of summer, I would definitely give O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE another try. This seems like a pretty straightforward drink. Its coconut juice and its pineapple juice, with a bit of sugar and not much else.They claim its a good source of potassium and electrolytes.For me it was pretty tasty. Granted it was also very sweet. Is it a \"health drink\"? I dont know if Id go that far. It has Vitamin C and trace amounts of Calcium / Iron, but not much else other than sugar.For what it is (something sweet to sip), its pretty good. I think this is a great product but my picky dog gets tired of it after a week. I didnt mean to order a 40-pound bag. But I did. Wow. Thats a lot of food. Be sure to mix it with protein or else you dog will suffer a bit of internal distress. It seems most of the organic/shade grown/fair trade coffee is medium or dark roasted, so Ive been having a hard time finding something that I like.  While this doesnt wow me like some other coffees, its priced cheaper than those coffees and its a good brew for when Im not really paying attention to what Im drinking (like when Im working).Im definitely going to keep this one around, and just switch to the expensive (better) coffees that Ive found when I can really enjoy them.Compared to other coffee thats not organic/shade grown/fair trade, this is an average light roast.  Good, but nothing to get excited over.  Its worth purchasing over those coffees because of the growing practices. In my quest to find snacks that are not empty calorie types, this is one of my new favorites.  Great taste, and although a hefty calorie count, the decent amount of protein makes this a good choice for eating on the run, if a real meal just is not an option!  VERY satisfying.  I also tried the white sesame crunch, and that is ok too, but this one wins for taste. This was actually a gift to my daughter (along with 3 cases of other Baxters soups). Shes of the opinion that Baxters is absolutely the BEST canned soup on the Planet (of the soups shes tasted, which include the major American brands - she doesnt cook much). The Lobster Bisque rated just below Baxters Scottish Smoked Salmon (which she rated the BEST EVER). (From my own perspective, and usually cooking my own food, I have to admit that the Baxters soup line, for canned soup, is superior). This soup is pretty good, not great! I put some heavy cream (1-2 oz) and some Tabasco in it. I have had a lot better Lobster Bisque - But at a much higher price... The flax seed is packaged in separate smaller packages so that it can stay fresher longer and it was recommended by the flax cookbook I purchased.  This seed was cheaper than other brands I had checked on.  I am putting it away for any emergency that may arise. I hope that this is really as nutritious as the claims.  I chew on this like the Romans and Greeks and it gets stuck on my molars.These seeds were easier going down when sprinkled on top of crab and egg fried rice.  Go figure.I incorporated a 1.5 cup into the regular white loaf recipe from The Breadbakers Apprentice and found that the addition meant more warm water was needed to hydrate the dough and I did not get much of a rise, so I baked the loaf with tin foil over the loaf pan and the bread rose to its usual height.  Since white bread is not that healthy, I will include flax seed ground in my food processor to ameliorate the ill effects. Based on other Amazon reviews, I tried this product.  The first shipment was great; delicious.  Thought Id found my new healthful snack. 2nd shipment was a concern and disappointment.  Even thought of calling the company; but i didnt.  Several different packages had incredibly hard pieces of ??  wasnt sure they were almonds.  Became concerned Id chip a tooth, so I havent ordered any more. Love these snacks! Theyre a little bit sweet, loads of crunchy almonds. Am looking forward to trying the other varieties, too. After reading some of the frothing reviews criticizing Mrs. Mays for manufacturing their product in China -- which doesnt in any way address the quality of the product itself -- I tried to confirm this for myself. The website and packaging say nothing about this, so I wrote them an email asking where their product is manufactured.

To briefly address these: There has been no evidence that Mrs. Mays keeps its workers in sweatshops; despite the Communism, Im sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable; and ships produce 1/10th the carbon per pound-mile of trucks, meaning a 5000 miles by ship is as bad as 500 miles by truck.I really like the snack and Id give it five stars, but Im subtracting one star: I think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in China. I dont have a problem with the snacks origin, but Mrs. Mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves. Granted, most of us Americans are primed to flip out at the latest Scare of the Week, but that should be our choice to make.Oh, and the snack itself? It is quite tasty, filling, and healthy. I will continue to purchase it. Good product just a little mellow on the pumpkin pie flavor to me. A little sugar on top before you brew picks it a enough though. Overall good coffee I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know its green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and3) if youre going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although its marketed as iced tea powder.Enjoy! lots of uses for this green tea...I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....in the ground form known as matcha.A quality product. Dissolves well.I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened. I make a \"jug\" of this tea every morning and keep a glass throughout the day.  Im delighted to find a source in the US as it was introduced to me in B.C.  It does not have the jasmine flavor which upsets my otherwise very strong tummy. This tea is more ginger than lemon, so if you like the taste of soothing ginger, youd like this product. I mix two packages per 16 oz BPA-free Camelbak bottle, filled with 8 oz of water and the rest ice, and a packet of stevia. Shake well, take sip, ahhh - no-calorie sweet tea, green tea antioxidant, and great for summer. I called the Stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet, and the rep said \"negligible.\"I also buy the Stash powdered mint green tea, and I prefer the hint of mint better. Again, if you are a ginger fan, youd really enjoy this product. This is a quick & easy way to make green tea. It isnt sweet & only has the barest hint of blueberry, but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning. It does have more green tint to it than most teas- heres why: \"Sencha green tea comes from the Kyoto region of Japan. It is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea. Additionally, the color of the tea is actually green, not yellow, like many Chinese varieties.\" Powdered tea is also good for cooking as well. I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. Ive tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you dont drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, its really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesnt stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, its useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again. Good flavor, but not real sweet.  I add a little stevia for my sweet tooth. lots of uses for this green tea...I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....in the ground form known as matcha.A quality product. Dissolves well.I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened. I really enjoy this tea because its not to sweet and its easy to use.  I carry it and my mug with me and just add hot or cold water, depending upon my mood.  I find that it gives me just the right kind of energy and it can even hold my hunger between meals. A real great thing because I watch my calories.  And of course, green tea is full of antioxidants. Powdered green tea with lemon & ginger provides quick daily source of antioxidant ingredients desired but in higher concentration and without the bother of brewing tea bags. Simply pour in water bottle, shake and be on your way.Product used to be available in local health food stores but is no longer carried. Much easier and more cost effective when bought in quantity on Amazon. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012BSMJM\">Stash Premium Green Iced Tea Powder, 12-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a> Easy to mix and refreshing with ice. I purchased this item when it was on sale.  I wasnt certain if Id like it but Ive read so much about the health benefits of green tea I wanted to try it.  This is a nice, pleasant beverage. The flavor isnt too strong.  I add a packet of Splenda to make it a bit sweeter.  The powder dissolves easily in cold water.  The flavor is natural not fake.  I was impressed enough with it that I have signed up for auto-delivery. This is one of my favorite water add-ins. I think it has a really crisp, clean taste...with a hint of grassy-ness. The tea particles tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle, if left standing for more than a few minutes, so I have to shake it up periodically. There are times when I feel like Im drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a lawnmower, but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener. It tastes great when I use stevia, but when I use Sweet & Low...I get a bitter-ish grassy taste. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012BZGHS\">Stash Premium Mint Green Iced Tea Powder, 12-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a> Light mint taste, easy to mix powdered tea, great on ice. I am pleased the bag is so large; it means Ill be sipping this tea for a while.  This tea is perfect for the start of the work day:  the rose and hibiscus liven my senses; the caffeine pushes me to type a bit faster as I climb over a hillock of e-mails.  The flavors are a bit more pungent than similar blends Ive mixed on my own (is the cause the mysterious \"natural flavor\" another reviewer pointed out?), but it is still quite pleasant.  I certainly look forward to many more mornings begun over several cups of rose congou. I am enjoying this tea and the price was reasonable.  I dont think the rose flavor is as pronounced as my favorite rose tea, but since I can not get that one at this time, I ordered this one, and it is very good. The popcorn itself is yummy, just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper.  The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped.  Its great in the microwave or a pan, but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper. This is really good. Tender, a little sweet. Easy to make in the Whirley Pop, and excellent with some Cheddar & Spice popcorn seasoning! I was a little concerned to buy the popcorn, as you never know what you are going to get.  But I did and I am glad I did.  The popcorn is nice and tender, pops easy, great taste and hull-less.  I have moved from the microwave popcorns and glad I did because of this product.  I like the fact the the popped corn is small but great! Baby white popcorn from Wabash Farms pops nicely, has no meanacing hulls to get into your teeth, and is very tasty. What more could you ask from a popcorn? I highly recommend this product. At least a four star. I love little white kernels of popped corn.  This was good stuff, but I think Ill try a larger white kernel to pop next time, my preference. My doctor told me I must eat \"hulless\" popcorn if I have popcorn at all.  Because I cant give up my favorite snack, I bought this Wabash Famnily Farms Amish Country popcorn.  The kernels are tiny, but they pop well, although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn I get from the grocery store.  It tastes great, however, and has fewer and smaller hulls.  I dont think there is such a thing as completely hulless,but Ido notice thst I dont get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore. I ordered 3 6lb bags with free shipping because of the reviews. I really like it but the real test was my wifes opinion and we also ordered 4 and 1/2 lbs of popcorn from the Boulder popcorn co and the kernels were a little smaller and tasted better. We use coconut oil and it has very good flavor even without butter. I really like the Cambrias Cream kernels the best Weve enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the Movie Theater Popcorn.  Its light and fluffy - tender - and delicious.  I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no \"palm\" oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more. I liked the idea of the small popcorn.  It pops up really well in the popper but it doesnt have much if any \"popcorn\" flavor.  Was pretty bummed by that. I used to grow the Japanese hulless in small quantities for my stovetop popper. This is the closest I can find. If you are appalled by the shipping cost, like I was, try looking elsewhere for a better deal. For instance, one popular site offers 6 lbs for $11.95 with FREE shipping if you sign up for repeating shipments (which you can cancel any time). Try www.c**king.com. This popcorn brings me back to days before the microwave version. What a treat it was to savor the taste and lightly salted lily white popcorn that was popped over the heat of a stove burner again. This is delicious popcorn -- lost a star because I use a hot air popper and many of them  \"jump\" out before popping.  Great flavor, great texture - tender.  I do not add anything even though I have purchased three different flavored toppings.Thanks, Why is this $[...] when the same product is available for $[...] here?http://www.amazon.com/VICTOR-FLY-MAGNET-BAIT-REFILL/dp/B00004RBDYThe Victor M380 and M502 traps are unreal, of course -- total fly genocide. Pretty stinky, but only right nearby. This is our preferred clam chowder . We like the natural taste with lots of potatoes. The only complaint is I think the soup can be creamier. Amazon has much better price on this with subscribe and save. Its not as good as I hoped, but canned chowder never is. I added some butter, a can of chopped clams, and some milk - then thickened it a bit. It works great as a base, but not for me straight out of the can. For canned soup this is very good clam chowder.  Those who give it 1 or 2 stars are comparing it to homemade soup or restaurant style soup.  I would buy this any day over other brands.  You can tell it is all natural and without loaded msg, salt and other nasty ingredients.  Pure and clean soup.  Those who rate it badly, some say it has no flavor or there arent chunks in it.  The flavor is mild, but that is good- not overwhelmingly clammy and not over salted like conventional brand canned soup.  If I want to, next time I will add a potato cut up in chunks to boost its contents- not a big deal to do.  I would prefer to do that than buy a conventional brand that doesnt care about healthy ingredients and sourcing of ingredients.  I will buy this again- good source of iron as well. Even though the chowder is very very good as is - I add a can of the Bar Harbor Chopped Clams to it - along with a can of heavy cream and a huge pat of budda ....yummy ... This soup lacks the key ingredients that make a canned clam chowder great: Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (soy/cottonseed), dehydrated potatoes, modified starches of all kinds, hydrolyzed corn gluten, MSG, potassium chloride, sodium phosphate, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, and succinic acid. What good is a classic New England clam chowder without these classic ingredients?Instead, the first ingredient listed is: Clams. Next youll be telling me its got butter in it (it does? Oh.).On a more serious note. Bar Harbor makes a good tasting clam chowder. The first list of ingredients came from Snows and Campbells condensed New England clam chowders. This Bar Harbor stuff is worth it. very good clam chowder.not as good as being in Maine in a restaurant but much better then other canned chowders This arrived earlier than expected, which was great! However, for some reason, this particular product smelled a little like \"fish food\".... but no worries, still tasted like great cashew butter, just the smell was kinda weird - like fish food. Also, I wish this product was organic. I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high-fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what Id eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the \"healthier\" options. Ive tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they werent very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though its closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals Ive eaten. Its like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.The bottom line is that Ill add this to my grocery list whenever its on sale or the price is right. I like the slight pineapple flavor in this better than the plain coconut water. Good well chilled. Coconut water is supposed to be a healthy drink. Love this juice. Scheduled shipment is convenient and economical. This is a very expensive beverage and any way to save some money on it, is worth it I really like this coconut water, but I was surprised that per 17oz box its the same price at Wegmans.  Probably wont be ordering again unless theres some sort of discount. Its high-quality and the price is right, especially with subscribe-and-save via Prime, but after months of trying to keep up with my subscription, I had to put it on hold.  Im not a big water drinker, but this stuff has a distinct flavor and when youre using it as a work-out beverage four or five times a weak it eventually wears on you.  Or me, at least. Id still recommend it, just dont OD the way I did. Ive always wanted to like coconut water - low in calories, high in minerals - but Ive just never liked the taste much. The pineapple juice in this really makes a difference. It still needs to be well chilled to be good, but it makes a healthy post-workout drink. I found this coffee flavorful and bold.  I didnt experience bitterness.For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.My favorite k-cups are:Starbucks French RoastStarbucks Caffe VeronaStarbucks Pike Place RoastGreen Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran ReserveGreen Mountain Double Black DiamondGreen Mountain RevvGreen Mountain Dark MagicOther k-cups Ive tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold We have several of these machines at work and Ive tried lots of different flavors and blends...this is one of the few I can keep down without my body convulsing with an involuntary shudder.  Lots of these instant coffees are very bitter or far too strong.  This one is actually very tasty. I have had Green Mountain coffee before, but had not tried the French Roast.  I am just realizing that there is a taste difference between different manufacturers, even with the same types of roasts.  The Green Mountain French Roast has the flavor I like and was expecting.  The price was reasonable and my order shipped quickly.  My only disappointment was in the shipping packaging.  I knew that I was ordering 2 boxes of K-cups but was surprised to see how big the shipping box was.  There was room for 3 boxes, with the extra space filled with bubble-wrap, which seems wasteful to me.  But on the whole, I am very happy with my coffee! This coffee has a nice bold flavor, not too strong, but smooth and bold enough that you know your having a wakeful, full bodied cup of coffee that is really enjoyable.  If you like a distinctive, medium bold cup of coffee you will love this. I prefer stong coffee but my husband does not like it quite so strong.  It works well for me.  The way he made it work for him, he makes a cup and a half and that suits him.  It also makes the KCup last twice as long! Out of curiosity I compared with side-by-side with Tullys French Roast k-cups.  These Green Mountain k-cups do not have quite the full bodied flavor of Tullys.  Both k-cups are good, but if youre going after a French Roast with the most full spectrum and thickness of flavor then Id recommend Tullys French Roast k-cups. I enjoy the Peanut Butter Cookie Crisp, but they are definitely a departure from the originals.  Still my son LOVES them so for this reason I still give it four stars. These are good but the flavor did not resemble an oreo. I purchased these along with the chips ahoy and those did resemble the flavor of chips ahoy. In my opinion these tasted like animal crackers. I will stick to chips ahoy 100 calorie packs. As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.Enjoy! We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the \"Oreo Biscuit\").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the \"modern\" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for \"hill\"), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the \"cream\" in between.Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: \"Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees\").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit. FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIESWhen I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 Oclock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASEBasically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they dont want it to be a 600 calorie confection. Thats why the biggest print on the label says, \"100 calorie packs\" -- 4.5 inches across!WHATS THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + \"ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS\" & \"ARTIFICIAL COLORS\" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIESBOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVESAs diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didnt find any saltines around the office hed head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history. I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. Thats the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of \"A Star Is Born\" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. Thats why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Dont get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are \"100 Calorie Packs\", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. Its just that I dont feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack. Let me begin by saying that I do not like Oreo cookies at all. I think the cookie part is bitter and I hate the white cream filling. When a friend suggested I try these I was reluctant and kept telling her that I was not interested. She insisted so I tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all. Im diabetic, so this is not a snack I will be eating often, but a few here and there wont hurt. If youre expecting these to taste like Oreo cookies (Im one whos glad they didnt!!), then youll be disappointed. But if you want a chocolate snack thats low in calories and fat please give these a try. Growing up on Oreos and milk is common. So I was taken aback with the brand extension of Oreos to cakesters. And while I had low expectations, I must say these are better than normal Oreos. Although I cant say itll beat the combo of oreos and milk, these are fantastic treats and relatively guilt-free.  If you like cake and like Oreos you cant go wrong with Oreo cakesters.The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience. Certainly worth a try - guaranteed enjoyment! These are more like a cracker - good for a little fill in for between meals. I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. Thats the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYEL1A\">A Star Is Born</a> the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black.

Its just that I dont feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack. Dude, these things are pretty good... as long as youre not bent on them being just like Oreos. I mean, theyre not. But I definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like teddy grahams. The lightness of the crackers makes them perfect for slathering on other goodies, like peanut butter, cream cheese, icing, pudding, melted chocolate... These arrived in the middle of May and they have an expiration date of the first week of July. This means I have to eat a lot of these in the next few weeks! Just beware if youre planning on stocking up for the future...the future will get here very soon with these!Its also interesting that the box inside the Amazon box says \"For internal use only\". Im not sure what thats about! you can find the sogo sweet rice mochi at Costco now, just 7bucks sth<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042TR2WE\">Sogo Sweet Rice Cakes Japanese Style Mochi Assorted Flavor Cannister</a> I was looking for a wheel. You know, like the one sitting at the bar at a restaurant. I wanted to offer some broken pieces along with olives, pepperoni, and some prosciutto.  All for a New Years eve party. Well it was not a wheel - thank goodness because it was half a wheel and at 20 pounds for the half wheel, 40 pounds would have been way too much. The flavor was excellent, just enough of bite.  The creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance. I broke up the half wheel into thirds and decorated a tray with a cascading effect of broken pieces. It was all well received with the choices of red wine. There was more than enough, which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks. I am looking forward to ordering this again - Super Bowl is right around the corner. It is big, so make sure you can carry and store this quantity. As far as cost, I thought it was a great deal since it seemed to have much less rind than what we purchase elsewhere. The cost per pound may be average, but the amount of actual usable cheese is there with the great flavor. Ive made these twice in cupcake form, topped with red jam and powdered sugar. Of course it doesnt taste like a normal vanilla cake... more grainy in texture, with a subtle sweetness, and some  spice.But I think they are super tasty. They didnt suffer from the weird chewy texture I often run into with rice-flour based mixes. Also used EnerG egg replacer with no problem. I used this mix to make a 9x13 cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil, spring water, and free range eggs.  I thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what I was expecting.  I was craving a white cake (like wedding cake) and went to my local store to find something wheat-free, gluten-free and dairy-free; I purchased this vanilla cake mix.  I think it is a very good mix.  I couldnt really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor.  The cake is yellow, dense (but not like a pound cake) and texture-y like brown rice has more texture than white rice.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  I think I would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it. ****Celestial Seasonings Sugar Plum Spice is a delightful holiday tea. It contains hibiscus, roasted barley malt, roasted chicory root, rosehips, chamomile flowers, natural plum flavor with other natural flavors, ginger root, roasted carob, and cardamom. It does not contain caffeine, so its technically an herbal tea.Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use \"natural flavors\" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called \"effervescent decaffeination\" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, \"Take a sip of Sugar Plum Spice and journey with us to the Land of the Sweets in Tchaikovskys The Nutcracker. Here youll find gingerbread houses, trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine. This is the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy, who is beautiful, gentle and kind. We created this tea to pay tribute to her. Sugar Plum Spice is made with 100% natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice, with just a hint of sweetness.\" This tea is slightly sweet and full bodied, tasting just as you would expect from the description. The cardamom and ginger give it a little zing. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.I recommend it, even if its not a holiday. Its perfect for a cold or wet winter day.**** The cookies were kind of stail but other than that it was fast shipping and good packing the cookies werent broken My primary reason for ordering, was the picture had shown the cookies as green. I will acknowledge that the \"Important Information\" heading listed a warning that the actual product may be different, compared to what was shown. Aside from the color problem, they were shipped quickly, and properly. Only one or two broken cookies on arrival, but its no big deal, I eat a few when they come in anyway. Im not sure what flavor they are, but they are delicious, as per the description. If youre not picky on color, good value. These cookies were a big hit at our progressive New Years Eve dinner.  Everyone enjoyed reading their fortune each time we arrived at another house. They really kept the party moving... This is a great product, however, you can buy it in a salumeria in Brooklyn, NY for $9.99.  Frank & Sal on 18th Avenue--Brooklyn. And Im editing my review because amazon assigned me the profile name \"LIAR LIAR.\" Animals! I was only stating a fact about what a rip-off the site is.  In the future ,Amazonn please dont call me a liar. Thats not nice you stupid thieves. I bought this for my sister for christmas...she loved it, but was afraid shed eat all of it at once, so she took the box to work.  Within 1 hour, it was finished by all her interns! Okay, not like the butter most people would expect, but a very smooth, full and slightly savory vegetal flavor. The first time you take a sip, you might not notice it, but let it sit in your mouth a bit before swallowing and then take another sip. The more you drink it, the more it will become apparent. It is very soothing to the pallet.Jin Xuan Golden Lily Oolong from Summit Tea Company it a good if not great tea, especially for the price and quantity you get. A solid every day drinker. It is not as complex as some that Ive had, but that could be due to how long ago it was harvested and a number of other conditions. Depending on how you brew it, a serving of these leaves is good for 4-5 infusions before the flavor wanes, making it an even better value. And even then, the broth is soft and sweet.If you like your Oolongs more on the green side, then you should give it a try. I know Ill be ordering another tin. When Im working, I always carry my own lunch. Its so much better than the food court, and I have much better regulation of my nutrient intake. Finding items having high protein without high fat is the most difficult task. Tuna is excellent and these little Chicken of the Sea White Tuna Cups fill the bill. Put one in the lunch with a few fresh fruit and veggie items and perhaps a few dried fruits and nuts. Its good nutrition, and theres no worry about weight gain. Also, when Im camping, I like to take a batch of these tuna cups along. In both cases, the cup size just the right for one serving.I had a minor problem with the latest tuna cups, and it might be just a batch problem. My latest tuna was very dry. I almost had to choke it down. And it seemed rather tasteless. Ive had these cups in the past and they seemed much better. I have not been satisfied with the present ones. However, I like the product and the serving size and It will not deter me from future purchases.Gary Peterson I love portable electric corrals.  They are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping, etc.  They are easy to use, give your horse some walking around room,  dont require a level set-up area, are flexible for size/shape, and are  small enough to keep handy in your trailers tack room.  I much prefer using these to portable panels, high-lining, tying to the trailer, etc.There are many portable corral kits on the market, all very similar with the same kinds of components.  (Except the Zareba EZEE, which is a different animal.)  So Ill give you a component-by-component rundown on the items in this kit.CHARGER - This kit comes with a charger that takes 2 D batteries.  I was leery of this, having had less-than-stellar performance from a 2D charger in the past.  But this one works pretty good, producing a reasonable strength zap with 100 feet of electric tape (with good grounding in damp, solid soil).  If your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing, this should be sufficient.  The charger is easy to use, with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked.  The on-off switch is very accessible, and a light and an audible sound tell you when its on.ELECTRIC TAPE --  This kit is advertised as coming with 200 feet of ½\" tape.  My kit had only 100 feet.  100 feet is enough for one horse.  I dont know where theyre coming with up the statement `perfect for containing 4-5 horses for short periods of time.  No way, not even close, even if I had received the full 200 feet.  Of course, its easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store.  But beware that the more tape you add on, the less zap youll get from your charger.  So Im not sure if the 2D charger would be strong enough with 200 feet of tape.  The tape in this kit comes with a handle pre-installed.  Its a nice handle with a good feel to it, but it doesnt connect nicely to the posts.  I rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the  handle to.STEP-IN POSTS - These are my favorite kind of step-in posts.  Each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through, so you can set at the right height.  Its very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips, making set-up and take-down easier.CORNER GUY LINES - This kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal bracing stakes.  Honestly, Ill probably never use them.  With this style of fence, there usually isnt much (if any) tension on the posts, so  Ive needed corner guy lines.  Why add to set-up and take-down time?  But if you prefer to use the corner guy lines, I think youll like the ones in this kit.  They are nice quality adjustable lines, with metal stakes.WIRES, GROUND ROD, ETC -- Of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence, and the charger to ground.  The ground rod is a 12\" pointed spike.  Nothing special here.CARRYING BAG - Oh my gosh, A+++ for this carrying bag!  The bag has one long skinny section for the posts, and a separate snap-off zipper tote for the other components.  Within the smaller bag, there  are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece.  No more jumble of stuff!!!  I love it.  (One quibble - one of the step-in posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping.  The bag is made of pretty heavy-duty fabric, but not quite heavy-duty enough to stand up to a pointed spike.  And the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problem.)All in all, this portable fence kit is about as good as any Ive seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral.  Just dont expect it to \"contain 4-5 horses \", unless youre rotating those horses in and out one at a time. This kit pulls together several standard components rather nicely. I am using it for supplemental grazing of horses, particularly to get small areas that are not permanently enclosed as pasture, but that get overgrown and/or delicious.I like it. Setup time, once you figure out the components, is about 15 minutes. It has all the pieces to make a very reasonable temporary electric corral - tape, posts, charger, ground, and gate hook.The 8 step-in posts are fairly standard: they have nice pointy metal stakes at the bottom that make them relatively easy to insert in moist ground. You probably cant get them into rock hard dry ground, but thats not a surprise. There are clips to give you flexibility in the fence height. But - youve probably seen them at the feed store - this kind of post is pretty short and will feel quite short compared to a normal horse fence.The kit is supposed to come with 200 of 1/2\" electric tape. Mine (as a Vine kit) only had 100. This is enough for one very well behaved horse in a 25x25 square. The tape is not much of a visual barrier, especially with only one strand. This is not a fence Id trust for a problem horse or for long unattended periods. 200 would be enough for either two strands or to have a 50x50 square and would be a much better value of time spent to grazing time. 50 x 50 is still quite small and the fence is still not substantial. It would be straightforward to add tape, but adding distance also increases the load on the charger.The product description says 4-5 horses. I would not feel safe doing that. Two quiet horses who know each other well and are already familiar with electric fence, maybe three for very brief periods, if you had the 50 x 50 and were nearby or had a secure outer fence. For grazing, three horses would have the area mowed in just a couple of hours.The charger - which uses 2 D batteries - has plenty of zap new. I was pleased by how easy it was to work with. It has its own spike, allowing you to set it up away from the fence.  The connections are long enough that you can put it out of nose range. The grounding nail was easy to set up and pull out.I like that it comes with a simple corner bracing system. You can set it up without the corner braces, depending upon how tight you like your fence and how stiff the ground is. But when you need the braces, youre glad to have the option.The tape comes on a handy small spinning jenny, which is designed to hang on the fence when it is installed. Its a simple thing, and thoughtfully done. It makes it easy to unroll the fence when setting up, and easy to reroll when putting it away. There is no problem doing the whole setup and takedown by yourself.The hook for the gate isnt quite a match for the brackets on the posts. A little bigger hook, or some sort of metal bracket, would be nice, to give a sense of a more secure latch. Still, youre counting on the fence never being touched, so its not a big problem.The bag for the kit is amazing. Everything fits inside beautifully, with thoughtful pockets - even a special pocket for the instructions. It is easy to carry and extremely organized. I was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag, which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts. The bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag section.This is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence. I havent owned a portable fence for horses until now, but I am impressed and liking this product very much. Upon opening the package I was happy with the portability of the carrying bag, and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is. Its a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out, or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses. Once set up, it wont hold more than two of our horses comfortably. I dont think wed ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises!The instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it. I can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well (such as alpacas), but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them.  The step in posts are fantastically designed, the overall design makes the fence very versatile, setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go.Were very happy with its design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system, I think! This is a great temporary fence for 1 or 2 horses. It is kinda unwieldy and you may need a little help setting it up if you are a smallish person but it works great after setup. these are grossly overpriced.  It is a package of three boxes but when you take into account that they are a dollar of two per box than they should be, you then have to pay for shipping.  Sorry, I would skip them.  My local grocery store carries them and a box is anywhere from 2.98 to 3.49 each.  Although these are healthier than some other cookies, you still have to watch the fat, sugar and salt contents.  Whole foods are much better for you but in a moment or two of indulging, these fit the bill.  Just the price on this site is ridiculous!  Ask your grocer to start carrying them. For quite a while, before Amazon starting retailing food items, it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy underground-favorite brownie mix. There were blogs and food sites bemoaning how hard it was to locate.  So when we saw it on Amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family. The concensus was: it tastes healthier but, never the less, quite good. It is far better when prepared with at least a cup of mini-chocolate chips. (Not regular chips which can sink to the bottom.) We buy good quality Belgian chocolate minichips. This mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures. We like this brownie mix and I usually use the low fat recipe on it. I also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry.We still buy this by the case. These brownies are good, but the flax seed texture can be a real turn-off.  To minimize it, I added a little whole wheat flour, splenda and cocoa - BIG improvement and my guests never complained (like they did the first time I made the brownies!). My 22-month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food.  They are tasty, healthy, and have zero additives.  On the downside, every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking ROCK.  I can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth, so I worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth.  That being said, its been months and nothing bad has happened...and it hasnt worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas, its just something that I feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product. This coffee is a great alternative for someone who has acid reflux and ulcer problems.  The low acid allows me to still have my caffine for the day.  Maybe not as smooth tasting as my usual blend, but Im so thankful for it.  Really close in taste. I didnt have high expectations that I would like this but I love coffee and have trouble with nausea from the acid. I am a Starbucks fan and while this was not as full bodied as that it was surprisingly good. Nice to not have the acid issues that come with coffee, this did not bother me at all or make me nauseous. I still prefer the taste of Starbucks houseblend but now Im not sure the extra body is worth the acid. This is a good alternative that i found i liked better and better as i got use to it. Give it a try! I use this in my breadmaker but make it with warm milk and an additional egg, which greatly improves the texture. When made with just water and a small amount of butter, the crust comes out very, very chewy in my breadmachine. I have also made this bread and used carrot juice in place of the water, which makes it a beautiful color and naturally sweet. I love this bread.  I dont even like the smell of commercial bread; you can smell the chemicals from miles.  I added rosemary, garlic and olive oil to the mix and serve it just out of the machine; it was a hit with my dinner guests. The potato bread was easy to mix, rises well in my breadmaker, cooks as it should and best of all was very tasty. The bread has a near white bread texture, and was very good. I purchased all of the Hodgson mixes and this was one of my favorites. I enjoyed this water.  It was very refreshing.  I find I have some stomach sensitivity with some bottled waters.  I did not have that problem with this water.  Nice bottles.  Water comes from Washington. I guess I thought of this can as being the usual commercial #10 can, so the Price of about $16 a can did not seem too bad, but when they arrived I saw that these were somewhat smaller.  They are less than a half gallon.  I dont see the size as that much of a problem. All I have to do is rethink how I would use it in a recipe and free shipping helped with feeling better about the purchase, but if I saw that size can in a store I would not pay $16.00 for 51 oz. can.I would have to see what fresh clams would cost first.  I would like if they made the clams bigger chunks, but I could buy some fresh to add to it.  Most clam chowder is made with bigger chunks than what Snow makes.Good product despite the price! Not much to say. I ordered two large cans of \"Chopped Clams\" for some clam chowder that I will be making soon and they arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. I have not opened them yet but will in February at my bosss home in the country. I will be making clam chowder in his kitchen with his wifes blessings. There will be a small group of us there and we will be shooting guns as part of the days activities. I hope they like the clam chowder! Things could get ugly... L.O.L. These are great beans for the price. If you live in a big city, however, Id suggest buying green beans at a local Ethiopian shop or even a community Coop. I also remember a Pea berry out of East Timor that was outstanding, but this Tanzanian Pea berry is comparable to standard beans. This is the best hot cocoa Ive had in a K-Cup!  The taste is smooth and creamy.  Its perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink.  I would definitely recommend this product.  The best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so I never run out. The kids love the hot cocoa and I like the fact that I can get the stuff shipped to me when I need it without worry of order. AS  A CHOCOHOLIC FOR  MANY YEARS I CRAVE A GOOD CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE.  THIS DONE IN THE KEURIG IS REALLY EASY AND FAST.  THE MILLK CHOCOLATEIS TASTY AND THE DARK CHOCOLATE TASTES LIKE THE MANY CUPS OF COCOA I HAD AS A CHILD.  NOT PARTICULARLY CARRIED AWAY BY THE  PEPPERMINTFLAVOR BUT IT WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH  TO MATTER. Arrived quick and on-time, and what a great value! Definitely pleased with my purchase, and will likely buy again =) To everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these k-cups, heres the trick.  Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad. When I was talking to a neighbor about getting a Keurig she told me not to get cocoa.  This was in a group of beverages that I got when I ordered my Keurig and I think it is very good.  It is rich, creamy, and exactly what I want when I want a cup of cocoa!  I would order this again. The Grove Square Hot Coco K-Cups have a good flavor but I find that the k-cups do not have enough hot coco mix to make that perfect cup. Thus I recommend putting a little less water in order to make each cup just right. nice variety pack. has 3 dofferent hot chocolates in one package. milk, dark and peppermint. nice holiday feel. good for company during the season. We received this order in perfect condition. I purchased this product for my mother-in-law. She likes the convenience of the product in the Keurig Coffee Maker. The chocolate does not stick to the sides of the cup like the cheap hot chocolate in the paper bags. Overall it tastes pretty good. It is a little weak but good. Use only on the small cup setting in the Keurig. 4 stars. I was disappointed by the fact that all three boxes I received had already expired.  Luckily enough, the flavors had not yet degraded.I specifically bought these in order to get the peppermint flavor.  I was hoping for more.  The peppermint hot chocolate does not have much peppermint flavor to it, but we will still enjoy it and both of the other flavors. This is delicious hot chocolate. It is best at 8 oz cup, but can be stretched to 10. And 8oz of strong coffee and you have delicious mocha I didnt read the reviews thoroughly and found out too late that this product has enough sugar to give it 60 calories and 11 grams of carbohydrate in each cup. I tried one with a bit of cream and found it to be very tasty. Ill keep it around for friends and family or perhaps an occasional mini-splurge. Id like to see amazon include nutritional info in the future. This is really tasty hot chocolate.  I like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference... This is a great hot cocoa as long as you read the box and only use the 8oz setting on your coffee make. Otherwise it will taste watered down. Also it is an instant coffee so dont be surprised by it. A good cup of hot chocolate...with a couple of marshmellows.  Make it for my daughter every time she visits. She is nearly 60, and she loves it. This item had a great price and tastes great. The only thing that could make this product better is if the little plastic cup was recyclable or compostable. My husband and I really like this cocoa.  I add extra milk to my cup for a creamier flavor, but the convenience cannot be beat. I feel like Ive tried every hot cocoa there is in the k-cups.  While I do think this is the best hot cocoa so far, it still isnt great.  Im not sure what it is, but all of the cocoa k-cups seem to have a weird taste to them.  Its almost like there is artificial sweetener in them,, but I know there is not.I set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa.  This has more body to it than others.Im still waiting and hoping that Dunkin Donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k-cup.  There really is nothing better than that.If you want a k-cup hot cocoa, I would def. recommend this over all the others. I have read some really funny reviews about this product.  Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so therefore it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, thats why 4 instead of 5 stars.But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little grittyness to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and youll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but its pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didnt, youll figure it out.  Btw, Id imagine the reason its always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  Ive dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.  Ill buy it again! When I weigh the convenience of a K cup against the price and the taste, I would characterize these as a winner. Not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet, these are pretty darn good. They nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that Ive had with some other brands. Do not select 10 oz on your machine though. Make it only at 6 or 8 oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion. All in all a fine cup of hot chocolate. I recieved a Keurig K-Cup Brewer for Christmas with sample cups of coffee and tea but no cocoa so I tried this brand and I like them but I havent tried other brands yet to compare with. I would buy these again until I find one I like better. I see a lot of complaints about Grove Square hot chocolate. I think it tastes ok considering its a k-cup, not homemade and not gourmet. I dont have anything negative to say the company or the product, its relatively inexpensive and the company didnt falsely advertise or make any promises about the taste. I really like hot cocoa!  I like it sooo much that I have a Cocoa Latte machine, which is great, but sometimes I just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher.  When that happens I used to put on the kettle and heat up the water, then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir, and stir, and stir.  And after all that stirring, Id still get little lumps in my cocoa.  With the K-cups, I get smooth rich cocoa with NO lumps and NO clean-up.  Easy and yummy!Please note: THESE ARE NOT SUGAR-FREE.  The very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and I did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients.  Each cup has only 60 calories, but if you want sugar-free or are diabetic then this product is probably not for you. I like to brew a k-cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha.  This dark chocolate flavor is quite nice, especially mixed with Double Black Diamond coffee.  Though not the very best, it is good, and the price is right, compared to other brands. Taste was decent, a little sugary, but very creamy otherwise. Very happy with this product. I will be buying this product again. Packaging interesting, as its a giant box for the product to float around in until it delivers to your house. My kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when I found these so reasonably priced I decided to give them a try.  We all loved them. All three tastes rich and chocolaty, not chalky at all. We were surprised how good they are, better than any other K-cup cocoa weve tried. Not too sweet.  The best K-cup hot chocolate Ive tried thus far. The kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate. Of the few Hot Cocoa flavors weve tried, this is the best so far.  It has the richest flavor and I dont notice the artificial taste that others have commented on.  Its also very affordable compared to other k-cups right now.  I thought that the k-cup making process must have gotten more expensive over the last year, but now I know they are truely sticking it to us since these are still reasonable priced. Better than expected, but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste. This is a good purchase for the price. Great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k-cups have.  Ive tasted several and this by far is the better one, but I have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.  Will definitely purchase more, but at the rate my family downs these, we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective. After trying many of the other hot cocoa k-cup options, I find that the Grove Square product tastes the best.  For my personal taste, I find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste.  Just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat.  However, this is not hot chocolate, which may be a turn off for some tasters. This Hot chocolate tasted very good!  The whole family liked it!!!  It is a nice change to make Hot Chocolate instead of coffee inthe Keurig coffee maker.  We wold purchase this again. I have tried a few of the cocoa cups and find this product about average.  Unless you stir the cup the cocoa will taste watery for a few sips. Reasonable in price, tastes good.  Prefect for Keurig, which can be pricey.  We will probably buy this again.  It is mostly for the kiddos anyway! I ordered this wanting to try a hot chocolate on my Keurig, and I am very happy with this product. I will definitely be ordering it again. That being said, I dislike hot chocolate made completely of water, so I do add a splash of Half and Half to my cup when I make this. Thus, I didnt want to give it a 5 star rating since I do doctor my cup up a bit at home (otherwise I would have). However, I wont even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water, I use 100% milk usually for those and they still dont measure up to this product from Grove Square. So, the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes. I do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that I have ever tried at home. Compared to the Swiss Miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it. Im a big fan! It appears a little watery, but the taste is not bad at all.  If you have kids that are as fascinated by the Keurig as you are, theyll probably enjoy this. Its a pretty good sub for the coffee shop version. No mess and the S&S price is great! I like that the box has perforations to remove part of the side so that it functions as a dispenser. This is actually better than I expected when I paid less than 50 cents each.  We usually use a packet mix and hot water from the brewer.  This is much easier and the taste is comparable.  If you are very particular you may not like this but for something quick, sweet, chocolate flavored and warm for around 50 cents it is worth a try.  I would not buy it at the regular price that some retailers ask. Getting really good cocoa out of a K-cup is not easy but this is much better than the others I have tried. Still a little wattery, but at 60 calories it is a nice treat.  very rich flavor - not as good as the real thing, bit I am not drinking it in a Berlin Chocolate shop either.  Put your slippers on, sit in front of the fireplace with your sweetie, and enjoy!60 cal (20 fat)  --  2g fat sat  --  11 carb  --  6g sugar  --  &lt;1g fiber Funny thing - I bought some of these K-cups several weeks ago based on the strength of the reviews at that time.  I just got them last week and have had a few cups since then.  Im using 8 ounces of water to prepare the cocoa.  I thought they tasted pretty good - reasonably chocolaty and smooth.They were sweet, but not overly so, and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box.  60 calories - hey, not too bad!  It wasnt until now that I came back to place a review and I read the most recent reviews from others did I realize they use artificial sweetener.  Honestly, if I hadnt read it I would have never known - I didnt detect anything that gave me the hint when I drank it.I think if you like a quick cocoa on the run youll be happy enough with these K-cups.  Are they as good as a Swiss Miss packet from Costco?  Maybe not, but in my office I dont want to deal with getting powder on the counters and needing a spoon to get things mixed.  Youll sacrifice a little for the convenience, but to me its well worth it. I am amazed how well these little cups taste.  These Kcups taste very well.  This hot chocolate taste great and are ready in one minute. As you know finding a hot chocolate that taste great and is brewed on the keurig is a big challenge. Well this hot chocolate is quite good. The flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it. I made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it.  Will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder. although this isnt a perfect cup of cocoa, its far superior to the others that i have tried. i will order this again. I havent actually tried drinking these just as hot cocoa but I know the peppermint flavor is great as a creamer for the Van Houtte Mexican coffee...Im ordering another box as this adds just the right amount of chocolate to my coffee.  Been trying to find a coffee flavor that does that but so far adding these to the coffee has worked out better :-) I usually have 14 oz at a time so I run 4 oz through as hot chocolate and the other 10 as coffee. I did try another brand of kcup hot cocoa and it wasnt as good as this brand. Unlike some others, this is actually IN a K Cup and not just an overpriced version of Swiss Miss.  While the flavor is not super premium like a Godiva or Ghiradhelli, it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak K Cup versions Ive had.  The sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix, but it isnt unpleasant.I like to brew this on the smallest setting (4oz) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave, I think that gives a richer taste. The peppermint is my favorite, followed by the dark and then the light chocolate.  They are all very good.  My only wish is that I could buy the peppermint on its own and not in a combo pack only. These are the only kind of cocoa k-cups I have tried, as I have a fairly new machine. My only complaint is that it seems like the taste of chocolate in the milk chocolate version needs a bit of a boost. However, I usually add another teaspoon of regular cocoa mix and the taste is great. The peppermint and dark chocolate k-cups are delicious. Definitely worth a shot for this great price! The price is wonderful! The Hot cocoa tastes great in 6 and 8 oz but 10oz was a bit watery to me.Dark Chocolate: YUMMilk Chocolate: Is very yummyPeppermint: For me wasnt enough peppermint but I just add a candy cane to mine.  I would recommend this again and plan on ordering more soon! Unlike the other hot chocolate(s), this one does not have that obnoxious after taste.  What a relief.  When I purchased my Keurig it came with a box of 16 hot chocolate K-Cups (name not used to protect the guilty), that have the most indescribable, particularly unpleasant after taste, all due to the \"fake\" sugar that seems to comprise most if not all of the product.This manufacturer does use some sucralose, but no where near the amount that \"other\" uses.  In fact, it actually tastes like hot chocolate during and after the sipping.  WhooHoo!!!!Will be ordering more - Thank You for my Kuerig hot chocolate reaffirmation. This is a really great K-cup cocoa. I had been drinking the Cafe Express but they have really gone up lately so this is a good buy . Nice creamy chocolate flavor so I switched to this. I found it at Walmart but this price is better  here for the 3 pack. Give it a try :) Ive tried all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the Keurig, and this is the only one I keep buying more of when I run out. Of course its not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix Ive had. It is richer than the same companys milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some. I ordered this because so many people were saying that it was sugar free. Its not. The first ingredient is \"SUGAR\". Its too much of a pain to return, so Ill keep it and drink it (because its a pretty good K-cup hot chocolate). I will think twice about ordering it again though. Id really like to get what I ordered. This is a very mild hot cocoa.  Perfect for those winter evenings or even good in the morning instead of coffee.  We love it anytime.  Next time I will try the dark chocolate. The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasnt strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesnt take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as Im concerned it wasnt an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa youd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I dont hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint... what can I say? Thats what its supposed to taste like. This is a great assortment and price...I only give it 4 stars because the peppermint is very weak in peppermint, so I add extract. Nice cocoa flavor to all, tho. Reminds me of \"homemade\" Well the product was good and the taste is great. The convenience was excellent and the delivery was quick. So whats not to love? The darn things tend to clog up my machine. Never ever happens with coffee. May one could run hot water after each serving to prevent the clog. Otherwise an excellent product. Im really baffled by the great differences of opinion on this product. Ive tried a couple of different brands and the Grove Square was without doubt the best. I recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local Joe Muggs (in a local BAM store) that was over $2  for the smallest size and really couldnt tell much difference. Obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many 1 and 5 star ratings for the exact same product? Oh well, I like it.p.s. 11-27  I like this cocoa well enough that I have subscribed to momthly delivery with free shipping and reduced cost! In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just cant resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. Its rather good. It says its dairy, nut and soy free, and Ill take their word. The question is taste. Well, its a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. Its a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. Ill pick it up again.Gary Peterson If youre looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter (whatever reason) this is a good choice.  Its nice and crunchy, tastes better than other brands Ive tried, and doesnt separate as much as others.  Best Ive found so far. Somehow I feel healtier eating these things instead of peanuts. I dont know why either. Also, unlike peanuts, I can limit my intake to a handful and not the whole bag. I know -- the description is clear enough about apples & cranberries but I found these sausages to be a little too sweet.  My guests agreed.  The same company makes sausages that I like better. Chewy Chips Ahoy and Keebler Soft Batch are very similar taste and texture. I decided to try this since a had a coupon for 50% off. Theyre slightly smaller than Chips Ahoy, but thats about it. My cookies arrived a little crumbled due to shipping, but no complaints because they were still edible and tasted great. Great Cookies, and now I have a stockpile of them :). My giant Schnauzer was weaned on this food. When we changed to Blue Buffalo, Eukanauba  Lamb and Rice, and Nutro he developers allergies. This is the only food that works. They taste good and give you a lot for what you pay. The meat was of high quality. I was however expecting each tin to contain one medium sized fillet. Rather, these are about 6 small fillet in a can, much more like sardines are packaged (but these are just fillets). Was a bit disappointing for that, and the info could have been more clear. Very nice product.  It is not a Mounds bar, but it helps satisfy the urge. DE is a very good coffee.  I ordered this as my father-in-law raved about it, and the whole bean aroma rood is indeed a good coffee.  It tastes like a medium coffee with a particular spice feel to it.  Very unique and very tasty.  I tend to make my coffee very bold even if it is a medium coffee, and even bold this is up there with some of my favorite coffees.If you are a coffee fan, this is worth a shot, pun intended.Enjoy. This is a very good, medium-roast, medium-bodied coffee. Brew it directly after grinding the bean to capture the most flavor. I remember really loving to eat dried mangos when I was younger so I decided to give this brand a try. These werent bad per se but they were a little too sweet for my taste. I guess its a good thing though since you dont want to eat a lot of them because the calories will build up unless you control your portions. Ill eat one and itd satisfy my sweet tooth for hours before I want to eat another one. Therefore, I guess its a good thing that its a little too sweet but still... I would have liked less sugar. Tasty, slightly different flavors then other brands, but good. In all other respects good purchase. Hard to find in US so I am not too picky. Bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer connisseur (sp) for his dog.  The dog didnt really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose.  Not sure, but it appears to have a very salty, brothy smell that could be the reason for the turned up doggy noses.  However, it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over, along with their master! I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and his roomates dogs. It looked really cute in the package but left the dogs exremely gassy. They are a german shepard, pitbull and a retreiver at fairly large sizes but it was a little rough on the tummy so use lightly. These muffins will not win any prizes for flavor.  I agree with other reviewers that the aftertaste is somewhat bitter and compared to (at least what I remember of) real muffins with sugar, gluten, eggs, butter, and that other good stuff they are quite fine.I do not eat gluten, derivatives of sugar cane, eggs, soy, dairy, corn . . . I could go on but you get the idea.  In order to use this mix I had to make substitutions and was delighted with what tastes like a treat to me.  Aside from the fact that I dont have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch, the best thing about these muffins is the texture.  Texture is a challenge absent gluten, sugar, and eggs, and I found this to be very much like how I remember muffins.  The bits of dried apple make these chewy and kind of weirdly so.Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. Folks who are comparing this to Hodgsons blueberry muffin mix obviously dont require gluten-free products (since the blueberry are whole wheat muffins). If, like me, you require gluten free, this is a great product. This is the first flavorful GF baked good I have stumbled upon. Very simple and quick to make. Like all GF products, they are pretty dense in the end, but the apples make for a nice addition and they fill you up. Personally, I added a bit more \"sugar\" (xylitol) than the recipe calls for. Next batch, I will also add some fresh apples and extra cinnamon. My only complaint is that you get so little out of the box (makes 6 small muffins). My family really liked these muffins.  I also made them while on vacation at my sisters house, and her family loved them.  I just got back from a Bible study full of pretty picky eaters, and they all said they were good.  Theyre usually pretty honest about how the gluten-free food I take tastes, even telling me once that some store-bought cookies I took tasted like cardboard.I did notice a VERY SLIGHT bitter aftertaste, but it was not too bad.  I think next time I make these I may take the advice of one other reviewer and add a grated apple for that extra touch.  Oh, and I only added 3 TBS of sugar and think they were really good, as did everyone else who ate them.  Im sure that if you add even more sugar, the slight aftertaste could disappear altogether.I just went to the Hodgson Mills website and saw that they did recently change the formulation to this mix, so maybe that improved the aftertaste.  This mix does not have garbanzo flour.  They use sorghum instead, now.  I did not make these as muffins.  I found that one box is perfect for 2 mini loaves, which I prefer to muffins.  Very good.  I will continue to make these when I need something fast and dont have time to make it from scratch.Oh, and to the poster who asked about gluten free pasta, Tinkyada makes a great brown rice pasta. I bought these for my  grandbabies because they are earths best and organic. They like them,but not as well as the cinnamon ones. I tried them,thought they tasted kind of like dirt. Good tasting and the pricing is pretty good. Its always sold out on Keurig.com, so I come here to make this purchase, I love Dark Chocolate! Reason for 4 stars, the pricing isnt great but its okay. My husband eats GF, and I dont, and its so hard to find him goodies, and hes always tempted to eat mine. Now he has some thing Im tempted to eat, I thought they were ok cold but if heated up they really taste yummy. I am addicted to these cookies.  They taste much better than the regular ones.  The only draw back is, that they should be available in smaller packages - to avoid binge eating. This sauce is good, but for my tastes it isnt hot enough.  I have had other brands tht have a sleeper heat that makes the sauce multi layered.  This sauce seems to ahve one layer. A really great Sauce but is slightly more expensive than in other stores. It is great for egg rolls or a dipping sauce for many chinese foods! It is also a great sauce to make Chili Thai sushi roll. The Panda black licorice is an excellent product.  The raspberry flavor tastes mostly like molasses.  This is fine if you value an all natural product, but it is not what I expected.  The two flavors that I bought have all been consumed so they tasted good. Not the best Ive ever had, but good. The best Ive had was expensive and from an English company (I cant remember the name). But this is better than the movie kind. Theyre not quite as moist and rich as the best ones Ive tried. The first can that I got of this wonderful oil was packed in a poor way: an old, reused box with not enough padding.  When I complained the company was quick to respond - with an apology and a new can packed well for the mail.  I was impressed with their responsiveness.  The Merula oil itself was excellent - a great treat. The Parisian Cafe blend is wonderful but it is too thick to fit correctly in the Senseo machine.  The box advertises universal fit but it is not. Smooth coffee, but a bit to big for senseo, interestingly all the other Melitta One pod flavors fit just fine in senseo, my fav are french kisses and vanilla haze. I had bought a Black and Decker one-cup coffee maker that used these pods.  It didnt work properly, but I have managed to use the pods with my old, stand-by coffee maker and am please with the flavor and convenience.  Someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging.  I have not encountered that problem.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase. Ras el Hanout is a versatile Moroccan spice blend that can be used for marinading meats (with a little oil and vinegar, maybe some crushed garlic), making stews, or just mixed with olive oil (and maybe a little crushed garlic) for dipping bread.  You can find many recipes that use it with a google term like \"ras el hanout lamb recipe\".  Note that it is sometimes spelled \"ras el hanoud\", so you can find even more using that.I first found this at the famous (and expensive) spice market in Istanbul.  This blend from Angelinas is nearly as good.  Note that there is no one recipe for this spice blend, and there are many private recipes with a good deal of variation. This spice can be tricky to get good quality and this one arrived quick and the flavors are spot on, use it to marinate fish or chicken then grill it, love it! This black truffle oil from Italy is fabulous.  Its strong and subtle at the same time.  Its the best deal for exceptional flavor. It is very good popcorn.  But I used a hotair machine so may not have been as yummy as if the oily stuff had been used.  Although I did pour oil on afterwards.  Why would I do that with an airpopper you ask?  Because the airpopper was a gift.  I really cant tell a whole lot of difference in the taste from Orville R. and this, but what I have read is this is organic and much better for you.  But the price is well...pricey. No I dont intend to buy again for that reason, but should my conscience tweek me towards healthier choice popcorn again then I may change my mind. This is a cool kit for gifts, or a great price on a kit of Daves Sauce if you use it at home.  A good variety.  My only issue is that the bottles do not hold in the wood gift box very well at all, they slide up and down until they fall out of the open spaces in the front or back of the wooden gift box.  I would buy again. This was a great selection of hot sauces, with a good variety of flavor. Each of the different bottles had a unique taste and each of them had a heat around the same as tabasco sauce. Oh, except for the Daves Insanity. That will have you pleading for the sweet release of death.But the other sauces are very tasty, and very usable in everyday cooking. Recommended. My son loved all the sauces.  The only sauce that was way too hot was the Insanity Sauce, use a teensy tiny bit when using. This is good stuff, and hard to find in the local pet stores here in ne pa. One store carries it at times but runs out and at times I send for it through Amazon.com. The price in the stores can be very expensive, and the price through amazon is up in the air as the price fluctuates in the store and the shipping at Amazon adds to the price. I wont discuss price except to say if your dog likes it and is not allergic to it then you have to pay what it cost . My dog has lots of allergies and is not allergic to this so I pay what I pay. Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor. The aroma is sweet spearmint. The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample. If you cannot eat regular chocolate, these are just wonderful.  YUMMY.  For diabetics and people who are choosing not to eat sugar (plus fewer calories) these are very tasty. If you have dry skin, give this a try. A doctor recommended I try this when I complained of itchy skin due to dryness. Its definitely more moisturizing than the bar soaps I used to use.As someone already mentioned, the packaging design is horrible. I used to keep almost empty bottles propped upside-down in my shower caddy, but then decided to use a pump bottle instead, which I refill.Dove -If youre reading this, please redesign these bottles so that they are more user-friendly. In Japan, you sell liquid Dove soap in pump bottles, and you even sell refills packaged in plastic bag, which are far more eco-friendly and less expensive. Please consider doing the same for the North American market. I LOVE this body wash!  It smells nice, works great, and feels great on your skin.  Add in the fact that with the Subscribe and Save deal, it is a great value, Im sold! Both my husband and I use this body wash.  We both have dry skin and feels it does a really good job as a moisturizing body wash.  It is a little pricey here, basically comparable to store prices (Walmart/Supermarket).  I order for convenience, one less item I have to waste time at a store getting---with our busy lives it is needed so we tend to get many items from Amazon, mostly through the Subscribe and Save program. The content has been consistantly good. The calamares have been tasty. The price was also very reasonable These cookies are both yummy and well priced. I recommend them. Other cookies I like are Mrs. Fields(packaged), Chips ahoy soft baked, fig newtons, oreos, and elf cookies. Its a lot of cookies, but the price is very good compared to the local grocery store.  The packages were in good shape and the cookies were fresh.  My order from January 25th has an expiration date of April 28th.  Not bad, but I would have preferred a later expiration date.  Other than that, no problems.  Exactly the same Chips Ahoy you would buy in the store. Delicious cookies.  I actually thought I was ordering the white chocolate chunk cookies, not the chewy, but definitely enjoyed these.  The only down side, is these seem awfully small. Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. They are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--I sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture. This is a very tasty product. Tastes more like tuna. However I believe the 35mg of salt listed on the indgredients for a 1/4 cup serving is much lower than the actual salt content. I use very little salt and these are somewhat salty. I also opened a can of Crown Prince natural brisling sardines in water which has a salt content of about 45 mg. The crown prince tasted much less salty than the Roland sardines. So I think Roland needs to be a little more careful about their packaging and list of ingredients. My guess is the salt content is comparable to a can of water packed tuna, maybe 210 mg or higher per 1/4 cup serving. 4.5. Just water and large pieces of sardines. Open for all types of combinations of which I find the old whole grain crackers, quality cheese, a particle of mayo and mustard and a hot cup of tea, the most appealing. They do lunch in a hurry and snack times as well. Solid product. Even drank the water in which they are laid to rest and not too shabby. Sardines are good for a person, everyone agrees on that. Even a Sardine sandwich sounds about right in the next few minutes (the better the bread the better the sandwich...) so yes, 4 Solid Stars and I am hungry for the product right now, come to think of it! These are the best skinless boneless sardines that Ive tried and they are very reasonably priced.  They remind me a little more of tuna fish than sardines, but in a mild, rather than bad, way and are very firm for water-packed fish.  I especially like these mixed with salsa. They work out to $1.57/can or .36/oz if you choose the longer, but free, shipping. Im on a very low sodium intake- 300mgs per day- and these are great. Good taste and low sodium. I just put a little mustard on them and yum! This is a favorite chocolate bar of several family members, made so by a visit to Germany. Hard to find in the States. Glad to know where to get them. I usually find the citrus sodas too tart/acidic for my tastes, and I find the black cherry Fresca too cloyingly sweet. I LOVE the peach; its so crisp and refreshing without being acidic, and is just the right sweet for me. Other than ginger ale, its my favorite \"white\" soda. I have been having trouble finding this in the grocery, and really hope it hasnt been discontinued. These are one of my favorite ways to eat grains  Plus they are a good source of protein.  17 chips per serving is just about right.  I wish they had a little less salt but for the calorie/fat/fiber content, they are pretty healthy.  Great with soup or salads or just plain.  I would definitely recommend these. I love this flavor of Soy Crisps...Deep Sea Salted. However, they are not available in the smaller individual size like most of the other flavors are. My husband prefers the lightly salted ones because they are crispier that the sea salted ones. Hes right, but I do like this softer crunch too. It sort of reminds me of popcorn. In fact, I dont mind the big bag on occasions...for example if it is a replacement for a big bag of popcorn while watching a movie! What a nice healthy treat! Im a big fan of the carbs, fat and protein balance of these crisps. The salt isnt overpowering and the taste is OK. Ive had better soy chips (Genisoy Tortilla Chips) but these are alright if you dont like the crunch of a chip. These are the most consistent soy crisps I have had. They are light, flavorful, and always fresh - and usually arrive in very good condition (not crumbs). They are a bit salty, but thats the only point that might be bad - just depends on what youre expecting. Love this product.  Very flavorable to most anything.  Works great on lunch meat, ham, potato salad, more.  Something similar is sold at Honey Baked Ham locations, but this product is much better. I bought the Blue Icicle because I had to quickly record some trumpet lines and I didnt have an interface. Well, actually, I did pick up an open box unit that didnt work because they couldnt provide me with the external power supply, so I took it back and got the Icicle as a quick fix that would get me where I needed to go in a timely manner.Hardware: iMac, dual core 2.0 GHz processor and 4 GB or RAM. OS 10.5.8.Software: Garage Band.Mic: Shure SM57.Pros. For recording trumpet with an SM57 it was perfect. Clear sound, low noise, LOTS of signal. With the gain a little over half way on the Icicle and about 58% in Garage Band I got hot horn lines with gain to spare.  Any hotter and they would have started clipping, so it definitely gave enough signal to get the job done.Cons. The gain knob has no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it - it has to be done by feel making it almost impossible to duplicate your settings exactly. This could be improved with a knob with an arrow and a marked dial so you can see where its set. It also feels a bit cheap - its lightweight and feels almost fragile. Treated with care its fine, but I doubt it would take much abuse before it would break and I have been ultra careful with it because it feels so lightweight and cheap.  I also used it as recommended in the accompanying literature and didnt plug it directly into the back of the mic - I used it with a mic cable.For what I needed it was perfect - simple plug and play that got good sound into my computer, and it worked well in a pinch.  I just wish it was a little higher quality in terms of construction.  A bit heavier and a better dial for the analog gain, and I would have rated it a full 5 stars but as it is, I can at best give it 4. The Icicle is truly a great piece of hardware. Its as simple as plugging your mic cord into the product and plugging that into your USB. The BEST thing about this product is it allows you to take your mic wherever there is a usb equipped computer. It is light weight so I dont know its durability and dont plan on throwing it to find out. The Icicle comes with a gain knob which is a plus BUT remember with this is a 60 dollar plug n play tool so it doesnt have any other features.*also i didnt have the noise/feedback issue Ive owned this product for about a year already and it is still working completely fine; although, there was a few technical issues I had to figure out myself. Theres no problem with the Blue Icicle itself though. There would be a problem when trying to install this with Windows 7. There was no problem at all using it with Windows XP. It seemed like it would install a different driver instead of it being Blue Icicle. Instead, it would show up as USB Multi-Channel Audio Device. It just didnt sound the same when I was using it with Windows XP. It sounded more louder with some feedback in the background. What I did to fix this problem was to uninstall the USB Multi-Channel Audio Device driver from Device Manager, then unplug the Icicle and plug it back in. When the Installing device driver software notification pops up, click it and click Skip obtaining driver software from Windows Update. It will now be installed as Blue Icicle and work like how it should be! Make sure you raise the levels up in Sound in Control Panel if the mic sounds too low for you, even with the Gain Control Volume up; it shouldnt be up that high anyways as it would have some feedback in the background. Im not sure if Im the only one with this problem, but I hope this helps whoever does!When I first got the Icicle, it sounded amazing and I had a lot of fun with it! I still do, too! I use this with my Audio-Technica AT2020. I use it almost everyday, whether if its for music producing or online gaming with friends. And yes, this does work for the PS3 -- not sure about the Xbox 360 though. I recommend this product for anyone who doesnt have a mixer for their microphone cause mixers are kind of expensive! Haha. I already have the Bluebird from Blue and was using it to record a friends live performance. With only a laptop computer at my disposal, I was able to connect my XLR to USB directly into Garageband. The Icicle is small, portable, and so easy to use-- plus, I didnt have to carry a huge A to D converter! Have only had the need to use this a few times, but it has always performed well and consistently. Nice that it has a little preamp so you can control levels - doesnt seem to color the tone in any negative way. I have little doubt that the Blue Icicle will get the job done with a Shure SM-58, or similar \"dynamic\" microphone.  But its claim that it will convert any \"condenser\" mic, even one that normally requires XLR connection and phantom power, into a \"plug n play\" USB mic should not be taken at face value.  I say this because I have an acquaintance with the original Audio Technica AT2020 Condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion.  In the long run, he would have been ahead (in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks) by purchasing the AT2020 USB mic.  As it is, the Blue Icicle is probably the best such converter on the market (the comparably priced LightSnake cable will not convert condenser mics, despite what you may have read).  So, if necessary, give it a try--and more than one.  But make sure there are return privileges. Works fine for my Podcasting needs. I use it with a sure SM58 microphone. It is made of plastic and does feel cheap but I have had it for a few months and had zero problems with it. For desktop use it should be fine. Works great for my needs. Wouldnt recommend for heavy use on a stage or being tossed around. This device does one thing and it does it well. I use it to record demos and it provides a crisp, clean sound with zero noise! I have read some reviews where people complain about the durability of the icicle. While it feels a little chinsy, I hardly think it will snap in half. The price is right and the sound is great.For the most part, setting the icicle up is incredibly easy. I had a few instances where I had to reboot for Windows to recognize it again and such, but no serious headaches.Overall, this is a great device to have on hand of for the traveling musician who wants to quickly lay down ideas on the road. i have used the icicle a few times, and it sounds great! everything works how its supposed to, and it is a very simple but efficient interface. the ONLY thing that i can see thats wrong with it, is it just feels light and cheap. granted its only around $40 so you cant expect too much from it. the plastic just feels rather cheap. but i plan on treating it very nicely and gently anyways so all in all i dont foresee a major problem on that front. 3 years ago I bought a Digidesign 002 protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording - but I could never get it to work with my OS on either computer.  I was at an impasse for a long time until I saw this product on Blues website.  I already had a $400 condenser mic in the closet I had never gotten to use and didnt want to spend more money on a quality USB mic.  I couldnt be happy that this product exists - in its quality or price!  I noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem.  It does exactly what its suppose to do -- act like it doesnt exist.  It just serves it purpose to convert the signal well, and stays out of the way on everything else.  It does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought (as many reviews said) and that is the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars.  But I dont think that should keep anyone from getting this product. Ive had this product for 6 or 7 months at this point and I use it for podcasting. Ive used 3 different mics one was dynamic and the other two condenser. All three have worked just fine as if I had plugged them into a mixer or a PA system, no problems. I have also beaten the crap out of this thing, knocked it around way too much and left it on the floor at my desk where I record, no problems still runs fine and its not showing any signs of stopping. This thing is also super easy, plug and record on any software including the free Audacity software, Garage Band, and Sony Acid (the three Ive tested)One problem, that gain knob, while very useful, is super super touchy. I found a volume I liked and then taped it down, otherwise itll jack up or down the gain with the slightest jostling. Doesnt make this a bad product, it just means have some tape handy and this is a quick and easy solution especially for podcasters who dont want to be limited to the USB microphones and dont want to shell out big money for a USB compatible mixer. using it for recording vocals on home PC using Shure C606 mic. It is a big improvement over the mic to stereo in for sure.. There is no background noise which was very prevailant in the mic in method. The 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the gain. Even with the gain knob turned all the way up i still had to add gain from my software for the sound to be loud enough. But overall a great product.. do not regret buying it and would recommend it as well. Pros: Easy to use. Plug it in, set your levels and go! Works well with Condenser Mics. Has 48v Phantom Power. Runs solely off USB (No need for a wall wart).Cons: Very plastic. Feels like it could snap with the slightest bit of rough handling! I wouldnt try to plug it directly into a mic. Use an XLR cable. No headphone monitoring jack and quite a bit of latency when monitoring with a separate interface. I would not recommend it for Dynamic mics. I tried it with my Rode Procaster Dynamic Mic and could not get high enough levels without practically yelling into the mic. I also tried it with an old V-Tech handheld stage mic and levels were a little better, so dynamics with a higher line output might work better with it.Overall, it does what its supposed to, but it could be a lot better. For about $30-40 more, you can get better interfaces with 2 mic inputs, but this one is nice for situations where running off of USB power is a must. Simple, plug-in setup. Garageband recognizes it right away, as long as its opened as first step, before plugging in Icicle. Nice, clean, \"transparent\" sound without much coloring with my Electrovoice stage mic. Depending upon your setup, you may have to crank up your inputs and headphone volumes to get comfortable levels.  Blue recommends plugging directly into computer. A great little device for the price! I have some nice mics round my place for video and thought I could use them to help my skype chats, and for the money it is amazing little USB device. I was a little concerned after reader some of the reviews here, but the warranty, Blues reputation, and Amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try. And in general, Im pretty satisfied with it. Using it with one of my Oktava MK-301 microphones I get excellent sound, no hum, and so far, excellent reliability. Im using it with Audacity and a few other programs, none of which have any difficulty recognizing it. There were some issues setting it up initially, and Im a bit leery about the plastic construction, but for what I paid I think its a good value. For those thinking of using it in field recording- stick it inside a carrying bag, and tape the cable to it to prevent stressing the USB connector. You shouldnt have any problems. Going from the $600 Digidesign Mbox to this $15 tube made me feel like I got back at Digidesign for screwing all of us who had XP computers that they refused to support after we bought their over-priced gear for recording voice overs.I could wish that the Blue Ice converter was made of heavier materials and came with a CS department that one could reach. But, for $15... well, nough said. This product has worked since the first day I have had it. Tremendous buy for me. I needed my mic to go directly into the computer. Thanks. \"Patrick\" gave a spot on explanation of everything, just in different uses. Personally, I use it vocally, and acoustically and it has worked perfectly in every way, however, either something is lacking in craftsmanship or  i find my ability to adjust by feel is a little more connected to using numbers instead of blanks. I found the quality just like Patrick said. I too think it \"feels almost fragile;\" And, \"I also used...a mic cable\" because for me, that seemed the most sensible solution because I didnt really need it to move it. So, I mounted the connection to my desk; And now I move it very little. Aside from the \"no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it,\" on the gain knob, i think it would be awesome if they just threw in some molded heavy something to give it some weight for setting on your desk. That would make it secure and you would feel like it had a little better quality in craftsmanship. Hey maybe even give the connector itself a littl weight to stay put. Anyways, great product but I guess, \"Thats what... he said?...\" Regardless,Pros: Does what it says. Get it if you need it. Its at an amazing price compared to the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPXFAG\">Shure X2U XLR-to-USB Signal Adapter</a> version. This, however, is fantastic for people saving for a new Presonus interface like me.Cons: Craftsmanship appears lacking. Plugged direct into windows and controlled via ustream.tv software interface - this worked well, (although we needed a little more gain - obtainable by using better software - cubase, garage band etc), as an interim setup before we could get a more pro level interface for more than one mic etc.  Nice!It feels a bit flimsy construction wise - but we were not going to take it on the road! This product works. If you are only looking to do vocals this is a good product. So far Ive had it a few months with no experience of sound distortion or loss of power. Its great if you dont want to go to the trouble of figuring out how to use a mixer. Ive been told a pre-amp is better but it seems to work alright for me and my MXL 67G. I was really worried when I ordered this that the phantom power would make it overheat, apparently I was worried for nothing! I use this paired with a Blue Yeti Pro, a seriously beefy microphone, running over shielded cable that is about eighty feet away, Its absolutely great!The one downside that I have seen from this piece of kit: It will occasionally not register as a USB device, Granted I only have seen it happen once, but you will always want to double check your connections! Cheap and works well the only thing is the gain on it is a little low even at highest setting. Other than that ir records well and does what it needs to. Im glad i came across the blue icicle (on amazon othere prices where 60 or more) before i went on to buy a mic, preamp and source for phantom power. I literally got i all in one at a verrryyy low price. Good bargain. i recomend it for anyone with a home studio and deff go buy a xlr cable. plugging a mic deirectly into it wont work so well. A great tool for low budget home recording. I mic every track to Audacity. I use a low budget dynamic mic and the Icicle gives the right boost for PC recording. I keep the gain at 90 to 100 percent and do volume control on the PC.I see some complaints out there about durability. Keep in mind it is a piece of computer hardware like a modem or an external hard drive, NOT something that you would use onstage or throw into a gig bag. Another plus is no drivers or setup. Thats important to me when I get home from work and want to record a tune. Just plug it in and go! Great price for what you are getting.  Recording via a USB port ROCKS!!!! The only thing that could maybe be improved is the durability.  It feels like a toothpick in your hand.  It may be more durable than it feels, but Im still going to be very careful with it.  But, for the price this is only a minor gripe.  Great product, I would recommend it to anyone. Bought it thinking this would plug into the Wii and I would be able to use my condenser microphone with it. Well, long story short, doesnt work. But it is still usable with a PC/laptop to record audio. But we can do that with a builtin mic also. Would u like to pay 1$ towards the presidential election? This replaces many of other brands of Pizza crust mix, cake mix, foccaccia and more.  The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is that it is slightly pricey, but that is an issue of living gluten free.  Enjoy and be creative with it. Finally-a Gluten Free Pancake product! Pancakes not to bad, taste like regular Bisquick. the batter is just right, not too heavy pancakes. this was a good price compared to local grocers. The first time I tried this product to make pancakes, I thought it was terrible.  I made it according to the directions and used the \"right\" measuring cups for liquid and dry ingredients, but found that the batter came out thin and the texture was gummy.  Then, one day when I was visiting my mother, she decided to make pancakes, and since I am GF, she had bought this mix for me (not knowing I had already hated it).  I saw that she measured the ingredients \"incorrectly\" as she used the same measuring cup (generally used to measure liquids) for both the dry and the liquid ingredients.  She also used a whisk to mix the ingredients.  Amazingly enough, the pancakes came out fluffy, and I really liked it.  In fact, it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far.  Having said that, both my husband and I are of the opinion that this product still has a bit of the gritty texture that is present in many gf products.  However, it is the best pancake mix that I have found so far. It makes good tasting gluten free food... but... like most gluten free food, its expensive and its got a slight grit to it. Ive made biscuits, waffles, and pancakes with it... a friend made some awesome banana bread with it. its very good for gluten free... My husband is gluten intolerant and as with all gluten free products out there the results are not always the best.  He loves this product and since I only really make the pancakes I cant say how the other Bisquick recipes would turn out for any of you.  And yes he has this texture and taste thing with gluten free products as well...  gritty, sandy or off tasting.... etc. etc...  So I am happy he likes this one!  With gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends.  My advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages, if possible.  I know on Amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you dont like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want!  Just a tip for all of you out there.  It may cost more for one package but the waste will be much less unless you donate them to the local food bank...  Good product and great results!  Thank you, Bisquick! I like the Bisquick, it works great in a variety of uses. Wish it came in a bigger box, the recipes are good on the box though. In trying to eat a little healthier Im reducing my gluten intake (gluten/wheat may not be the best for arthritis/inflammation) so I gave this gluten free Bisquick a try. Surprisingly, I was pretty impressed with the flavor which to me tastes almost as good as regular Bisquick.I followed a reviewers suggestion to let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after adding just the milk; the batter looked better and was a nicer consistency after the resting time. It was a little hard to get all the lumps out of the batter though and because I have limited GF experience I wasnt sure whether further stirring would gum it up so I left some lumps in and they dissolved while cooking.The texture of the cooked pancakes was very SLIGHTLY gritty. Makes pancakes a little thinner than with regular Bisquick however thick enough that Id say they are just right. See photo added.I used a cast iron griddle to make the pancakes, which made them barely crisp outside and nice tender inside - *very* good!!!The taste is close to regular Bisquick but a little more \"plain\" - I use real maple syrup and sometimes preserves and with either of the two toppings, I had a very good, very tasty short stack.My only quibble is that this mix is a little pricey but Id rather buy this mix than other GF products Ive tried that are just as pricey and dont taste nearly as good. This stuff is pretty solid. Makes a decent enough pancake for being GF and makes a solid biscuit as well. What we have found works best is taking this mix and using it half and half with the Chebe mix. Between the two it makes for a very nice flour mix. The Chebe is good but on its own tends to be a little squishy, but when you mix it with the bisquick, the bit of squishiness gives the dryer Bisquick the fluffiness and moistness it needs. So, I recommend this, but I would HIGHLY recommend getting some Chebe too and cutting the Bisquick with it. Also, even though this mix has leavening agents in it, when we use recipes that call for leavening agents we add them anyway, it tends to turn out better this way. Due to health issues, my husband is newly required to eat a gluten free diet. He acted as if he was on death row. Finding this product has help immensely. I can make him pancakes with fresh fruit and he doesnt feel he is being unfairly punished. Also, my neighbor was faced with a similar circumstance. I shared one of the boxes with her and she is now a fan! <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0\">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> I really love this product, I think it is a great overall flour replacement in your kitchen but I just felt the size was a bit small. I would have really loved to see the box be larger, I think there are three cups total in the box. Overall the product is amazing though. Everything Ive made with it has come out wonderfully and all of the recipes online via Bisquicks website are easy to follow and come out very good. Id highly recommend this product to anyone. My favorite things to make are the biscuits, I add a little cheddar to them to make them oh so good and the apple \"pie\" which is more like a coffee cake but good either way! Give it a shot if you are GF! I was so happy to find this product when it was first released! I had used regular Bisquick for years before being diagnosed with Celiac Disease. This is just as versatile as the original- pancakes, biscuits, dumplings, etc! My familys favorie is the pancakes, they are light and fluffy and have a lovely crispness to the outside.My only reason for not awarding this 5 stars is the size of the box, it is small. My family of 4 uses the entire box for Saurday morning pancakes. The box makes approximately 3 (small) batches of pancakes, we freeze the extra in single servings for weekday breakfasts. Id love to see Bisquick release a larger box but until then Ill continue ordering the 3-pack! <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0\">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> I grew up eating Bisquik, so finding a gluten-free version of the quintessential baking mix was wonderful.  However, a 16 ounce box only makes two batches of pancakes!  I would love it if the GF Bisquik could be made in a box size like the conventional Bisquik - especially since my family eats up the pancakes this makes even more than the regular ones. We found out last week that my son has MULTIPLE allergies, including milk, soy, wheat, tree nuts, oranges, tomatoes, corn (thus corn syrup and starch).  We are in the process of trying to find ways to make what he likes to eat and still avoid thsese ingredients.Does anyone have a list of all ingredients before I spend $10 on this product?Thanks My family loves Bisquick Pancakes, my kids did not notice the difference from this product and regular pancakes. The only problem is the price, I will try Pamelas this week, price seems more reasonable. I wish some of these companies would say whether the rice is white or brown rice. I try very hard to just eat the whole grain version of any grain as they are more nutrient dense(plus lower glycemic). Ive not tried this yet, but if it was listed as brown rice flour, I would have put it in my cart. Just in case you dont know - these are about $4 a box at the store, so anything more than $12 for a 3 pack is not worth it.  This is a great product, though (thats what the 4 stars are for).  The pancakes & pizza dough are great, I make them all the time. This product is so useful in managing a Gluten-free diet!  The inced. price @ Amazon .com makes it all a great buy. In the summer my doctor suspected I had a gluten sensitivity. She wanted me to start making changes from packaged food and think about cutting out gluten. After a bad few months I did some research and found this bisquick. I have only made one thing so far, garlic cheese biscuits. They were very tasty and had no strange texture or flavor. They had a more spongey texture than a crumbly biscuits but I was halving the recipe so maybe that was why. I nibbled on a biscuit hours out of the oven and it was still as soft and tasty. I cant wait to try pancakes and coffee cake. The only draw back is how small the box is for the price! I will limit the use to once a week or so for a treat! This is one of the best GLUTEN-FREE mix on the market!!! It makes fluffy pancakes and light cornbread.  Also it is a great price!  I have had different mixes on the market in all price ranges and this is the best!!! I used the Bisquick Pancake and Baking GF mix to make snickerdoodle cookies.  They were very good and stayed fresh for some time.  Thank you for offering this mix. I purchased this while out of town.  We used it a couple of times, but never for biscuits.  I did make pancakes out of it and they were pretty good.  Always use milk and butter.They are a bit heavy and have a slight slimy sense to them, but are significantly better than a lot of stuff out there. I did also use it to thicken some gravy and it was fabulous for that.  I used it for breading for chicken nuggets as well and it was good.  I would like to try this again  for pancakes, and make some biscuits before I make a final decision on it. This product produces excellent (outstanding) Belgian waffles in my Waring Pro waffle iron.  They exceed anything you may buy in a restaurant.  Truly!  However, at $5 per box, the cost of the other ingredients you must add, time to prepare, and the small amount of product in the box, I suggest you look at other gluten-free products from Pamelas, The Gluten Free Pantry, Bobs Red Mill, or Arrowhead Mills.  You may see a better value for your food dollars.  Incidentally, Arrowhead Mills products are equally as tasty and easy to prepare, but I believe you are getting more product in the bag.  Feeding a family of 4 would be a crap shoot at best with a single box of this product.If the manufacturer were to repackage the product with more content per box and drop the price, I would have given it 5 stars. Safeway was the first store in San Francisco to offer this product and placed it in the center of its baking products.  Now, however, it has fallen to lowest shelf level with some prices sold by higher end grocers approaching $6 per box.  Forget it at those prices.  Hey, its largely ultra fine white rice flour and super fine sugar!Bisquick would also benefit from a buckwheat GF product in its inventory.  I would certainly buy it. Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are \"drop \"biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I dont even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesnt have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonalds breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you wont go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I dont have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, dont prepare more than you need.About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably wont get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you dont have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldnt be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  You can find more recipes on their website.I recommend this product for the taste.  I do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price. I cant say that biscuits made from this mix taste as good as the regular wheat.  But that said, for those of us needing gluten free foods, its not bad either. Was on GF Diet for about 6 months. Used this new product from this old quality company with excellent results. Still use it for variety.A box goes a long way. A little expensive but worth it. I love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick. Not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though.. so I wish they had more recipes available. It does taste more \"gluten free\" than some other options out there. Made really great biscuits; even my non-GF husband enjoyed them!  My only complaint would be that the packages arent very big; I used 2 cups to make a batch of biscuits and I dont think theres even 1 cup left in the package. This product made wonderful pancakes -- I couldnt taste the difference between this Gluten-Free version and the original. I tried using it to make pizza dough to relative success. The texture was a little bit weird but it tasted good! This mix made tasty, crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron, but the whole box only made 3.5 waffles.  This would be a five star product for me if I could get more than one family meal out of it for the price. I like this product, and will order it online again since it is a much better price than the grocery store.  I wish the box was a bit bigger, but it will do.  It is plain, but it makes a light and fluffy pancake.  You can add flavor with vanilla extract, cinamon, or blueberries.  I liked the texture of the biscuit recipe, but it came out more like a muffin.  Im going to make it in a muffin pan next time and put cranberries in it.  I made my biscuits with butter.  If you are creative with the use of add ins, I think it would make good quickbreads, but not the rising type. The product is very good. Way too expensive and at almost 5.00 a box to get pancakes or biscuits I was disappointed My family is gluten intolerant and we use this product extensively.  Pancakes, biscuits, waffles, it doesnt really matter what you need to bake, this mix comes through.  This is my go to mix above Bobs and all others we have tried.  Try a box, follow the instructions for pancakes, and tell me they arent awesome... go ahead... I dare you. The coffee was good but didnt have a strong flavor. Wouldnt buy this product again. Nice to try new products and try new flavors. The thickness is just as described. They are not thin as straws like some other reviews had stated. My 2 pet chihuahuas love them very much. It usually takes them an hour or so to finish chewing so its a great time passer for them. One negative thing Id complain is the strong smell of the bag, though. I have to tuck it away in a corner in order not to smell it often when pass by. This might not apply to everyone, since my nose is a bit more sensitive than most normal people. Over all, Id had given 5 star if it wasnt for the smell, I have to give 4 stars for now. in my opinion these are heads and twos above any pickle that you normally find at your local grocery store.  a lot of nice, sweet, pickle flavor.  I probably wont buy again off of amazon because of shipping charges, but if i ever see them locally, ill buy a bunch. I was looking for holiday sprinkles in bulk and lucked up to find these.  I have purchased this brand at Williams and Sonoma before but always in small containers.  I paid the same amount here for the bulk package.  I am very happy. thanks for having it sent to me promptly. i was very happy to be able to order it online and get it the next couple days. Ghirardelli isnt the finest chocolate you can buy, but its pretty good, and the Intense Dark Assortment is both inexpensive, and provides you a few possibilities.Ive lately taken to unwrapping a 60%, 72% and 86% cacao square for each dinner guest and setting them on an individual saucer, to serve as an after-dinner sampler with red wine or Scotch. Thats been a pretty popular approach. A similar approach also works \"therapeutically\"---if someones having a bad day, sitting them down with a small assortment of increasingly intense chocolate isnt a bad path to feeling a little better.I do wish that there were the same number of each in the bag; thats the only downside. Of course, if you really want the sets of three to serve to guests, youll have to go through the tiresome task of somehow eating the extras. Darn. This is an excellent candy for those of us who have to limit our chocolate intake.  Each bar is sectioned into six pieces, which helps with portion control--and makes it perfect for sharing!  My only quibble is that its sometimes hard to get all the waxed paper off the candy, as its quite sticky. This was my second order of Bit O Honey.The first one arived with the celophane cut and one item missing.I hope Mr. Sticky Fingers found the candy as enjoyable as I did. Purchased this as a gift for a couple of salt loving friends - It is great and attractive! A note to purchasers: we had one vial of the salt arrive empty and it says no returns, if you contact the seller directly they will work with you. The seller send me a replacement vial (very quickly) and even sent a cool little salt dish along with it.  Will definitely get this set for others (maybe even me) in the future. I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes exotic salts, and it was a hit with him. It was well packaged with no breakage. (Some of the reviews have mentioned that they received broken containers.) The wooden holder is nice but not all that permanent. I would recommend this for someone whod like to sample various kinds of salt and doesnt mind paying a high price. The reason I gave it four and not five stars was the price. I purchased this tea for someone who enjoys Trader Joes white pomegranate tea, and unfortunately it was not a good substitute. Though I havent tried it myself I was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable.  I am rating 4 stars since this is such a subjective judgement, and I have no doubts about this being a high quality product. This is pretty decent coffee, for pre-ground decaf.  Heres how a coffee snob reviews it:* Unpacking *This coffee had to travel a long way to reach my house, and it was hot out.  Heat and time are enemies of fresh coffee.  The package was pretty hard to open, I resorted to scissors.  The grind is very uniform with no detectible dust.  The smell is stale compared to the local fresh roasted, non-decaf, beans I usually buy.* Brewing *I busted out my cone and loaded two servings into a Melitta filter.  I poured two cups of 200F water through.  The uniform grind is apparent in that the coffee didnt clog as it does with blade-ground coffee (due to dust).  I drank the coffee black...* Tasting *The smell is of decaf and or instant coffee.  Pretty stale but the decaf process is partly to blame.  Overall I enjoyed it as much as any drip decaf Ive had recently.  There was no biting bitterness.  I drank two cups black without much of a gut ache.Pros:- Tight packaging with little air helps maintain freshness.- Excellent grind uniformity.- Low bitternessCons:- Not locally roasted.- Not fresh. Best-by date is a year in advance.Verdict: For mail-order, pre-ground decaf, this coffee lived up to expectations and was drinkable.  3 or 4 stars. This Melitta Riviera Sunset decaf makes a better-than-decent cup of coffee with medium body and just a little bite. I used my my usual two heaping coffee scoops for six ounces of water in a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker.While I was enjoying the coffee, I read the package and saw that it recommends two level teaspoons of coffee for six ounces of water. That got my curiosity up so I measured out my coffee scoop and it is one tablespoon. Since I use two heaping scoops, thats slightly more than three times as much as suggested on the package. Following the directions would probably make a watery, undrinkable brew.The coffee has a nice even espresso grind, perhaps a bit lighter than a French roast. I would have guessed that it was primarily arabica with some robusta but Melitta states that it is an all-arabica blend from Central and South America. It is decaffeinated through the chemical-free Swiss water process which is the only acceptable way to decaffeinate as far as I am concerned.Also note the cute vintage travel poster-style label and the clever name: because its decaffeinated, its perfect to drink while watching the sunset. The main reason I drink decaf is to have the pleasure of coffee to go with dessert in the evening.  My caffeinated coffee is drunk in the morning... only one cup.  So this coffee is pretty good with evening dessert since I wont get wound up.  Flavor is good, packaged well, easy to brew. I had never heard of this coffee before but I got a bag and really liked it.  This Melitta Cafe Riviera Sunset Decaf is a very good decaf with a good taste and body.  This stuff is perfect for a late-night cup of coffee or for a cup with some dessert.  Its decently priced and I will definitely buy this again. Melittas Riviera Sunset Decaffeinated Ground Coffee turned out to be a good basic coffee - not bitter, not burned-tasting, a well-rounded mellow brew that tastes like real coffee. I had it this morning with almond milk, stevia and a pinch of cinnamon, and though Id had a bad night and didnt even know if I could handle coffee, it was delicious and easy on a morning tummy. Besides brewing it alone to get a nice decaffeinated coffee for night-time drinking (especially in the winter), weve been mixing it with regular coffee in various blends, depending on our caffeine-related needs at the time.The packaging is practical and easy to re-close and the grind is good for my automatic coffeemaker. I will buy this one again. I love coffee and admit that I am particular when it comes to good coffee.  I was not expecting much from this coffee and was pleasantly surprised to discover it was quite good.  It falls into the likes of Starbucks and other shade-grown coffee brands -- deep, rich flavor.Though I enjoyed it, I am not sure I would purchase this unless it was on sale.  I do find it a bit overpriced.  If you dont mind spending the money, you will be happy with this coffee.  Otherwise, I would suggest purchasing this on sale for a special occasion. I enjoy my coffee with plenty of sugar and a flavored creamer. This provided a good base for that experience. As a non-connoisseur, this is just about right: not too strong, not bitter, good \"coffee\" flavor.For the sake of comparison, I most often drink the ground version of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55MM\">Eight OClock Coffee, 50% Decaf Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> Right now on Amazon, Melittas is slightly more expensive per ounce, though Subscribe and Save would even it out and Melittas brewing instructions call for using a smaller amount of grounds. I would expect them to be about the same quality, and in my opinion they were. This is certainly a coffee Im happy to drink when I want decaf.One downside is the bag. My husband got to it before I did, but he reported that it required scissors to get it open. The resealing feature on the bag then couldnt be used, so we made the transfer to another sealed container. First off,  let me state that I am not a fan of decaffeinated coffee of any type.  But I often have guests over who ask for de-caf, so I gave this a try.While I agree with some other reviewers who have stated that there is a certain \"different\" taste about this blend, for me, it was not a bitter taste, but instead, a good, strong flavor that mimicked the strong (real) coffee taste I enjoy.  I had a second cup, and the flavor grew on me even more, and I thought: \"it really is delicious for a decaf.\"The aroma isnt truly satisfying (why does this always happen with decaf?) but I think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lack.The package had to be snipped open with scissors --this is tightly packed!-- and then I just poured it into a zip loc for storage in the fridge.Ill stick with regular coffee, but Im sure my de-caf loving friends will enjoy this. Im a big coffee drinker (much against my better judgement), but due to a stomach condition, Ive been \"forced\" to drink mostly decaf for the last few years. I usually just get the cheapest coffee I can find near my office; after all, I dont make a lot of money and every penny counts. So it was nice to get this Melitta Cafe ground coffee to sample.When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe its because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50-cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days Ive grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonalds (when they give out free cups).For a pack of 3, the price seems decent. If you drink decaf, I think this is quite worth a try. I would recommend this as a good basic coffee.  It has a satisfying flavor and will make many a good cup of coffee.  I prefer drinking my coffee black and I found this to be produce a good cup.  It is not bitter and even though I had the decaffeinated coffee, it did not taste flat like so many decafs do. My wife finds it bizarre that I enjoy a good cup of joe just before I call it a night. Yeah, sometimes I get a little spiky due to too much caffeine intake and so I thought Id give this decaff a go. What you get is a good cup without any bitterness but its a little weak and I recommend dropping about 50% more into your brewer to get a fuller flavor. Also, as its vacuum packed into a slim cardboard box it arrived completely squished flat - nothing like the fat photo in the amazon product shot. I know its a minor thing to complain about but I like leaving my coffee out next to the coffee maker and this item wouldnt even stand up. It was about 1/2\" thick!So youre not going to have Mr Wolf commending you for your great coffee with this one but for a decaff it aint half bad. I like the smooth taste of this coffee. It is decaf so not too strong but really not very light either. Its just the light coffee that sometimes needed at mid-day. recommended. This is good for packaged ground coffee, and for decaf, it definitely has a strong coffee flavor. This is great for that winding down cup of coffee late night that wont keep you up because of the caffeine.Each sealed package holds ten ounces of extra-fine ground coffee. The bag feels sturdy if you prefer to keep your ground coffee in its original packaging.With coffee prices going up, it may be a good idea to compare the prices of this (if you try this and like it, you get a better price with the Amazon Subscribe & Save option) versus getting coffee beans from your local coffee shop and grinding them at home or having the coffee shop grind them for you. I am not a big fan of decaffeinated coffee--I figure whats the point?  Taste is so often compromised.  I have recently found that caffeine bothers me if I drink it after 7pm so its decaff or nothing at that point.  Riviera Sunrise tastes like regular coffee.  I was so impressed I decided to try it as my morning coffee.  I expected to have a very negative response to not getting the morning caffeine of my usual coffee but that did not happen.  If you must give up caffeine this is a great solution. This Melitta Riviera Sunset blend is a nice, and light coffee that is suitable for anytime of day.  Its particularly great for drinking at night because it is decaffeinated.  The texture is nice, and does not have an acidic taste or anything.  Its meant for casual drinkers.  I do prefer my coffee darker, WITH caffine, but I did enjoy this blend.  I would recommend giving this a try and judge for yourself. This coffee was deep and rich, and did not have a bitter taste too it.  I did have to use a little more than what was recommended to get it the way I drink coffee.. but coffee is a personal thing everyone has their desired strength.  The coffee was fresh upon opening but began to go down hill really quick as far as aroma and taste goes, so invest in a good air tight container.  I liked this coffee, but it I could go on in the morning if I did not have it. We dont drink much coffee, and less decaf, but we have guests who do and so we like to keep some ground decaf in the freezer for when they visit. Everybody has been pleased with the Melitta. Nobody has complained about the taste, and plenty of folks have asked for second cups so they werent just being politely quiet. We got the first sample free through the Vine program but I would buy it in the future. This product had a good nice scent and strong taste. Not too unique compared to a lot of over the counter canned decaffs already available. But overall, its a good after dinner type of coffee to serve guests.Price wise, its reasonable but there are many other comparable products that may have a more distinguished taste. Overall, its a good product and worth trying for decaff drinkers. Ive blended this with a darker full-caf Melitta coffee and LOVE the results.The fine grinding is a tad small for the french press I use, but the taste is wonderful.I was a little concerned at the darkness variation in the two when I decided to blend, but the outcome was fine.The only real complaint I have is the packaging. Cheap glue on the metal fold-down part causes it to fall off (true for both bags I received), so dont rely on that.Otherwise, a delicious coffee that is mellow in taste the way I choose to prepare it. I have a Keurig coffee maker. You know, the one with the K-Cups.  To have a coffee like this, you have to have a special filter, which I do have.  Honestly, youll spend a crapload of money on K-cups if you dont get the filter for regular ground coffee.  Anyway, I dont know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way, but the water in my Keurig had a hard time seeping through, causing a bit of an overflow.  Aside from that, the taste was smooth and flavorful.  It has a coffee taste, plain and simple.  Is it anything special, not really.  It just tastes good and is reasonably priced. I have been enjoying the Melitta coffee in the evening. It has a nice smooth taste with none of the burnt coffee bean taste of Starbucks. I used much more coffee than suggested in preparation though. I used 2 tablespoons to eight ounces of water. I like my coffee strong but not bitter and this worked for a very good cup of coffee with half and half added.I will be buying it again. If Melitta doesnt sell good coffee, who does?  I grew up using Melitta filters and still individually make each cup of coffee in a single cup filter. Generally I use pre ground coffee (so I am not a purist), although I occasionally grind my own.  I usually drink two cups of coffee a day.  Enough about my coffee habits.Melitta is a pretty trusted name in the coffee industry. and I expected this coffee to be be a quality product.  I was not disappointed with the coffee, although it was not quite as exciting as the regular vanilla flavored coffee I recently tried from Melitta.  The flavor was pretty strong and rich, although decaf always has a slight aftertaste, even with the Swiss Water process used for decaffeinating.  Generally. I drink regular coffee as my first choice, but I admit that I switch to decaf in the evening.I have no problem recommending this coffee as a second choice... I do not like decaf coffee.  I think it has an aftertaste.  But, I thought I would give this a try.  It truly surprised me.  There is a mellow, full bodied taste with very little aftertaste to be found.  I will definitely buy it again to reduce the caffein in our household. Im not a huge fan of coffees from the Americas; I generally find them a bit light for my taste (Im a big fan of Sumatra and other Pacific-grown coffees)  But Riviera Sunset is a nice, light coffee, smooth and not terribly acid.  Its a pleasant coffee for people who like their brews with more brightness and less body.Im also frankly not nuts about decaf, but that aspect doesnt intrude too much on the flavor here. This coffee has a more present flavor than the stuff they brew for us at work, yet it goes down smoothly. To my wife and I, thats a good combination. The fact that it comes already ground doesnt do anything to subtract the flavor either. Ive tried to give up my coffee habit, but it just hasnt been easy.  DH and I did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago, so I suppose thats something.  Im a moderate coffee drinker- I like 1-2 cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning, and *love* a nice chilly iced coffee on a hot afternoon.  This Melitta \"Riviera Sunset\" decaf is smooth and doesnt have the bitter aftertaste that I dislike in one of the leading coffeeshop brands.  The flavor is great and Ive enjoyed it both hot and iced. What can you say about coffee, either you like it or you dont. I liked this coffee, although when I choose to review it I didnt notice it was decaf. That aside, it tastes fine (made in my Keurig) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one. First, lets talk about the packaging.  I hate when coffee come packaged in bags like this.  Theyre quite cumbersome and in my opinion, do not keep the coffee fresh enough.As for the coffee itself, this was one of the better tasting decafs I have had.  It has a very rich flavor that you do not normally find with decaffeinated coffee.  It has a wonderful aroma as well.  Very pleased with this product. When it comes down to Melitta, they definitely have known for all this time, what it takes to really made a great cup of coffee. With their Cafe Collection, they definitelly bring out the best in flavors for all kinds of coffee lovers, and that is really a strong aroma. With their Rivera Sunset, they definitely bring out a decaffinated taste that feels like it is full of pep at the beginning of the morning. I really love it. The taste is strong and the intimate aroma is just delightful. All in all, I absolutely recommend this as a great treat in the morning to wake up and enjoy.Price: BTaste: B+Overall: B 1/2+ I prepared this coffee in a french press (although it is ground too fine for this).  It had a nice aroma, a full taste and mild bitterness.  Its a fools game to try to describe the taste of anything in any detail-- so Ill just leave you with the coffee was quite good and it would make a good after dinner coffee.My only complaint is the coffee is pre-ground.  Ground coffee is a bit stale by the time you get it, however, a blade grinder will ruin the coffee as well.If you dont own a burr-grinder, this is the best cup of decaff youre going to get. I often find with decaf coffee to be somewhat on the weak side: not in this product.  The coffee had a strong grip, but not bitter, and had a smooth rounded experience when a creamer is used (note this coffee works well with a soy creamer).  You do not need to apply any extra heap of coffee to compensate for a decaf option!  With such a strong grip, I would not recommend milk or low fat milk as you might as well drink it as is! I remember the cool, modern Melitta drip coffee makers from decades ago. A visual delight of glass and wood (without a hint of plastic), they were elegantly ahead of their time. I wish I could say the same for their coffee. Its fine coffee. Good, actually. However, nothing really special. I would buy it again if priced right, but probably would not go out of my way to get it, and certainly not at a gourmet price point. I must be honest and say that with the Melitta name, I expected a little bit more. Maybe I just got a an \"off\" batch. Lets hope so. On an untypically cool August evening we decided to try Melitta Riviera Sunset Decaf. I heaped in too much coffee and what we got was a bitter, overly heavy cup . I know others like their coffee to curl their hair with strong taste. We like it strong but not THAT  much. On our next try we used less coffee and enjoyed a delightful semi-sweet cup of decaf. It was pleasing. Those who love strong, robust, full-bodied taste ought to definitely buy Melitta brand coffees. Riviera Sunset Decaffinated Coffee, from the Melitta Caf&eacute; Collection, is a good coffee for that first, morning cup of coffee.  It is a South American blend for those who prefer a brighter more acidic kind of brew, but is still well balanced and make s a fine cup of Java.The coffee comes in an attractive,  black bag with a bag with the now ubiquitous air valve.  The folks at Melitta know how to compact coffee for travel--all ambient air was sucked out of the bag, shrinking the usual size of the 10 ounces from its expected size, to a small, dense brick.  Cutting open the bag, there was an audible hiss as the bag seemed to expand to double its size.  The aroma was intoxicating--think deep coffee with chocolate hints and with nothing acrid about it.  The bag does not indicate the level of the roast, but on inspection the coffee appears to be a darker roast (somewhere between a `full city and European).  The bag states that this is an extra fine grind, but on inspection it seems to be less powdery than youd want for fine espresso, and is more of a fine grind.  This, I imagine, is meant a compromise so that the coffee is suitable for both the common drip coffee machines that use a filter or could be used with an espresso machine.For some reason, the instructions indicate that you should use two level teaspoons for every six ounces of water.  Im not sure how they drink coffee in Europe, but in the US coffee machines measure by the cup.  This leads to a bizarre ~2.7 teaspoons of coffee per cup and (to my taste) a slightly weak cup of coffee.  In spite of the grind, Id stick with the usual 1 tablespoon per cup proportion for your drip coffee maker and work up from there.  Your intuition should serve you well, and Id stick with your usual measurements (Im one of those `heaping tablespoon per cup guys).The coffee definitely shows its South American origins.  In spite of the darkness of the roast and richness of the aroma, the coffee once  brewed is more light, breakfasty, and slightly more acidic than I imagined it would be. Given the type of coffee that it is, it also might have benefited from a slightly lighter roast. Still, it is a well balanced South American blend.  It lacks the distinctiveness of a single origin coffee but given that it is a blend has a more rounded, less biting flavor.  Although decaffeinating can sometimes sap the bold flavors of a coffee, this coffee still has a lot of personality and a distinctive taste.This is not for the pure coffee lover who likes a dark, earthy, and oily cup of java that can basically stand on its own.  This coffee is more for people who like to add a lot of buffer--a fair amount of milk and sugar or one of those Torani syrups (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2QS\">Torani Syrup, Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>) for a little extra flavor, for those who like those kind of things.  It also makes a great iced coffee.  If cold brewed, the coffee loses its tannic edge and is more smooth and sweet, but also loses a little personality in the process. (I did not try using this in an espresso machine as I do not have one, but I dont think that it would yield a great espresso.  Concentrated, I think the acidity might become overwhelming.)All in all, this is a fine blend of coffee at a fine price.  With a little experimentation on the proportions, it yields a fine cup of breakfast coffee. This coffee had two strikes against it: it was decaf, and it was already ground. I do use decaf, generally in a 50/50 mix with full strength caffeinated coffee, but I always like to grind my own beans to assure freshness. Still, I thought Id give this Melitta coffee a shot (it was free from Vines, after all). Im happy to say it surpassed expectations. I made a pot without mixing it with anything and drank it black, as I always do. Its surprisingly drinkable, if a little on the light side. Still, the taste is fairly rich and appealingly winey, though I do like a little more smoky aftertaste than this provides. (Theres really not much aftertaste at all, truth be told.) Its as good if not better than nearly all the straight decaf coffee Ive ever had, and having it ground as opposed to beans really doesnt seem to be an issue here. Ground coffee does tend to go stale more quickly than bean, so Id suggest using it fairly quickly, but thats easy to do with a 10-ounce bag. If youre a decaf drinker and prefer not to have to grind beans, Id highly recommend this brand... I have had to cut back on caffeine recently because of heart palpitations that seemed to be made worse by all the coffee I drink (5 cups a day, maybe.) So I am mixing 1/3 Melitta Colombian and 2/3 decaf. I substituted this for the other decaf I have been drinking and found that it has a rich smooth taste. Very little to none of the burnt taste that decaf often has. The price on amazon makes it a pretty good buy as well. I dont care for the packaging, however. I couldnt get it open without cutting the top, and then I had to transfer it to an old coffee can to store it, with all the mess that that entails. If it were in a can, I would be more inclined to buy it. But the taste for a decaf is quite good. I have been taking this tea twice per day and I am enjoying the way I feel Hands down, by far the absolute worst tasting tea I have ever had.... and I have ALLOT! I am an avid tea drinker and I just cant get it down. The benefits are supposed to be amazing so Ill keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow its bad. So strong too, tastes like dirt (*thats been pissed on in the woods). I really like this tea, I started drinking it at the suggestion of a friend.It helps to sooth an upset stomache. I will be buying it again in the future. As an avid tea drinker of all corners of the earth, I have had hundreds of teas, and everything from this company as well. I read about this tea as a very powerful health herb but all the reviews said it tastes bad. What do I care? Id rather be healthy. I never take sugar in my tea either. If youve read this far you are waiting for me to say how bad it was. You cant imagine how bad it is. Without exaggeration I would describe the flavor as a very bitter tasting dirt. Yes, as a 32 year old with children I know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink. My recommendation is to let it steep for a shorter amount of time as to not make a rich bold tea. As you know, the longer it steeps the bolder the tea becomes. Yea, dont do that with this. Four stars because it is apparently very good for you and I thank the company for bringing it to us regardless of the taste of death when other tea companies are using Artificial ingredients to make their teas taste better. I bought these and yes they do come in plastic bags with a label on each but also included was a five sided box that you can fold together that has a picture of each flavor, one on each side. It makes a cute little colorful box, nice to give as a gift if you put it together. Id rate these as better than average but since I am not a fan of flavored coffees, Id only give them a 3 rating as to me they taste artificial and weird like all flavored coffees do. The regular coffees were very good better than many. I really liked the Amazonia and the Africana medium roasts, not so much the Colombian. The dark roast Eclipse, Mexican, and French Roast were very good. I made them into ice coffee, strong but not bitter. I didnt care for the Costa Rican light roast, it had an artificial taste to me. The House blend was good but nothing to write home about. I hate decaf so I used that K-cup to water my plants with, so as far as taste goes I have no idea but my plants perked up. The Chocolate raspberry went nicely into a chocolate cake batter in place of water and it was delicious. If priced right Id buy them again. I got this at a local discount store for $6. It has an excellent flavor and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead if 5 was personal preference. Im not sure why no one seems to like these very much!  They are pretty good to us.  I havent had a problem with them falling apart and theyre easy to slice for toasting.  My son,(who is the one on the GFCF diet), is extremely picky and suspicious of anything new, ate these muffins without hesitating. I sometimes poke a hole in the middle and serve as a bagel.  These are a regular staple in our house. If you need gluten free, non-dairy and no egg, pickings are pretty slim.If you use a really sharp serrated knife and work carefully, you can split them successfully.Great for mini-pizzas! These are ok. I like the sweet potato ones better and both have good fiber content. Tried this item liked it. This item was cheaper to get than buying at the local store, easier to get and it has a longer shelf life than what i was getting.  Around here driving 30 miles one way is local.  P.S.  These can make great mini pizzas shipping was really good,and i got what i ordered on time. will buy from again,alittle pricy but my little dog likes them. I love to eat pasta but totally clueless on how to make one...saw this while at the grocery earlier, decided to try it, followed the instructions and viola... one awesome dinner!! note: I did add some parmesan and romano cheese to add more flavor.. I went searching for charcoal dog biscuits after reading that they help with digestive gas and bad breath.  This appears to be only one of two brands on the market.  I havent tried the other one (I think its called Sportmix) because the other did not make a biscuit for small dogs.  My dog has been eating one a day and I cant say for sure whether or not they work. She used to have really smell gas; she hasnt dropped a bomber like that in a while so maybe its due to the biscuits - who knows?  She does like these biscuits very much, so I will surely buy them again. My 4yo Cardigan Welsh Corgi loves these things, and when they stopped carrying them at PetSmart, I had to go here for them.  They seem to be made of good ingredients, and theyre the right size for him.  Plus, he loves them and thats whats important! My dog loved these and I think they probably helped with his gas and dare I say his breath too. Great alternative for those who cant eat wheat. A little bland, but crunchy and crispy. Wheat-free, natural ingredients, easy to chew. Dry by itself but is good with coconut oil and/or fruit spread. This crispbread is nice and thin - great for those with more sensitive teeth.I eat 3 of these in the morning for breakfast with Smuckers Sugar-Free jelly on them.Guilt free and delicious.You do have to be a little careful when spreading heavy stuff on them like peanut butter.If you press too hard they can break.One thing you cant tell from the box is that there are actually 2 air-tight packs in the box.Im currently eating these and the ryvita sesame rye crispbread.Highly recommend both.Note: I have lost 12 pounds by changing my diet but I give the most credit to 2 things.  Rye crispbread replacing almostall of the flour in my diet.  And drinking oolong tea which helps burn belly fat.You do need to exercise a little bit too. I discovered these when I moved to Canada a few years back.  Before this I had only experienced a thicker Wasa crispbread and was a bit put off at first.  The feelings dissolved the first time I ate one of these with light laughing cow cheese.  They are a little more \"powdery\" than Id like, but they compliment most cheeses very well without overwhelming them. Product was as described. It was shipped promptly and I will be consuming it as part of a medically supervised diet..it is the only bread that Im allowed. Order these with the idea in mind of putting them in waffles, pancakes & a cookiie recipe that I had. looking for bits as real blueberries seem to have no flavor these days.. these were very good,  Would def buy again I have been looking at this product for a couple months and finally gave in.  First of all, the name got my interest!  The taste is delicious BUT Im having problems with the directions!  Havent figured out if its actually a hot beverage or do you put it in a hot beverage?!?!?!?!?  It has a scoop (small) and says to put that in a cup (instructions for 8 oz.) and then put a couple \"shots\" of hot water!  Shots of water????  And you can add frothing milk.  Hum!  Confused but I guess I will work with it.  Hope it doesnt take the whole container (very large) to figure it out. I would have given it 5 stars had I understood the instructions! Ive used this BBQ sauce before and it is good especially considering that is free of so many negatives (like corn syrup and for us gluten) but the price on this cant be right.  Order directly from the Daddy Sams website to pay $5.50/19 oz bottle.  This price would HAVE to be a case price although the description says 19oz. The ingredients are really wholesome. And, fast delivery!It would be nice if they had some type of fish formula though.But my dog loves them and will buy again! We switched to this brand because one of our dogs eyes always teared, and someone said it could be from a corn allergy.  This is one of only a few brands that is corn free and it cured the teary eye problem quickly.  BLUE brand does not contain corn, but they include garlic in their blend which can cause kidney problems in dogs over time according the veteriniarian.  It smells more natural than Purina One which I had been feeding them and they seem to like it better.  I like that the sales from the food go to charity too.  A good product. Great alternative to dog food with corn and other by-products. Our picky dogs enjoy this food and so do I, knowingit is better their health. I read all the reviews before buying this food and overall I was impressed with the product myself.  The dogs like it, they have no ill effects as 1 reviewer alleged (looking at her other reviews I think hers should be tossed by Amazon) and I can get it for even less on a subscription with Prime which means 2 Day No Cost shipping.  Whats not to love?  I do mix this with some Prescription Diet J/D since I have one \"older dog and 1 with some allergies and the combo seems to help.  Bottom Line:  It is a good product and after doing a ton of reading (I dont buy my animals cheap food or ANYTHING that I think comes from China) I think it does everything it claims. I dont know why, because it doesnt look very appetizing, but my two dachshunds love this stuff and scarf it down with great abandon. I have been using the product for several months now.  The dogs seem to like it and having it delivered is really nice.  What more can I say? My dog never met a meal she didnt love including this one.  The price is very good, especially utilizing the subscription option.  I make 2/3 of the food I feed my dog, its very easy and economical and the best way to control the quality. Ive yet to find any of the dogs I know that love it.  I still have my allergic dog eating it, but she has to be hungry to eat this without doctoring.  My vet doesnt want me feeding her people food so I add some of Newmans or Happy Hips canned to it.Ive talked to a couple of vets about prescription diet and they all push the big company brand names.  The common objection appears to be the soy used in Newmans to increase the protein count.I am willing to put a little flavor in this to feed may dog high quality, social responsible food.I may be the only person who has made the following mistake but, assuming you catch the Amazon sales, make sure you are ordering the bag size you want.  I thought I was getting a good price on one order until the food came and it was the seven instead of twelve pound bag. Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food Id been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets.  After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight.  Newmans own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years.  After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat.  That may be age related as well.  But the stomach upsets have stopped.  And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula. My 3 dogs love this food and are thriving on it.  Ingredients are high quality and Amazon price is better than anywhere I can get it except on sale. I was giving my dogs Science Diet Puppy food from the time I got them at 8 weeks. Science Diet changed the formula about 3 months ago and the food just did not smell or look right. It was very oily and fishy smelling, which I realize they did at more fish oil. After about three weeks of the new food, I noticed my puppies (well now 1 year olds) skin was very flaky like dandruff and they both had been continuous licking their paws. I took them to the vet and he said they had food allergies. He wanted me to take them off the Science diet and put them on pumpkin and pinto beans for 7 weeks. Well, under duress I tried it and my dogs did not eat for 3 days. I decided to try the Newmans organic and after about 4 weeks their coat looks so much better and the licking has really decreased. I am so glad I saw this food when I was doing research. I feel better about feeding this product to my dogs.  I was using another popular brand,but it contained a lot of fillers.  One of my dogs is \"pickier,\" so he would prefer a meatiertaste, but he does clean it up eventually. Good product. Dogs are vary satified with it.  Would like to have in a larger bag(20 lbs.), if this could/would be an option. I am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it.  All 3 of my dogs (2 Jack Russells and 1 dachshund) enjoy Newmans Own Dog Food and I liked knowing it was organic.  The kibbles are a perfect size for easy chewing.  My dogs enjoyed Newmans Own for about 3 months but then only nibbled on it so I decided to alternate it each month with another dog food to give my dogs some variety. After becoming more and more a \"coffee person\", Ive been trying various brands and flavors in an attempt to figure out which one I prefer. Ive tried other brands such as Dunkin, Kirkland, and various other store brands. I came across a great deal on a 3 pack of Community Coffee so I decided to try it. The packaging isnt the best once you open it, but I have separate air tight containers which I use (as I imagine most coffee drinkers would own).I prefer dark/bolder roasts, and I found that Community Coffee definitely fit the bill. My girlfriend didnt like it, claiming it was too strong, which further reinforced my belief that it was at the right level for me. I brew the coffee the traditional way (coffee pot), but also via cold brewing. Ive found that the cold brewed version of Community Coffee far surpasses the traditional, heat-brewing product. Im not quite sure if this is the case for almost all coffees, but it seems even more pronounced with Community coffee. This coffee was good but it had a distinctive aroma and taste like buttered movie theater popcorn. I am a huge hazelnut flavored coffee fan and this was good, It just doesnt typically taste like hazelnut. You may like it but I will search for a more true hazelnut flavor. Do a test, make popcorn in the microwave and then later make the coffee and you will see the similarities. Im not a coffee snob, so Im not picky about what kind of coffee I purchase. I chose this because it was cheapest by the ounce and best rated. I bought <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5WO0\">The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Hand-Roasted Hazelnut Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> as my first ground coffee, and I have to say, Community Coffee smells and tastes better than Coffee Beans! This is totally personal preference though.This Community Coffee ground tastes much darker and smoother and it smells good. Im no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a Starbucks (I drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk). Great coffee for a great price, especially if you get it when Amazon is offering the $3 off coupon. not the best coffee but it is not bad as well. we bought more after we tried the first time because for the price weve got it is fine. Godiva is still our favorite but this one is okay too. I thought this coffee was really good, but I think the next time I order, I will order something a bit stronger. The sinus buster tea had an interesting aroma when seeping; its taste is acquired not offense at least to say more like burnt bark or really overheated coffee. I had no drainage of my sinuses while drinking one cup of the tea the next morning I could feel relief of pressure and pain. I would prefer this product over any inhaled sinus relief agent. As a plus all the ingredients of the tea are on the package in english nothing unknown. I am having to change my original post on this tea. My husband and I both suffer from sinus problems. I made up a big tea pot (with 2 tea bags) and let it steep for 15 minutes. I had 2 cups and my husband had one. Neither of us noticed any difference with our sinuses. A few days later I decided to try the tea again. I brewed one cup of tea with one tea bag. I let it sit again for several minutes. I guess the first time I tried it I did not make it strong enough. This time I noticed a difference as my sinuses are a little clearer. I enjoyed this product.  They are a good value for the amount you get.  I did not sense much honey in the product, so a bit more flavor would be nice.  I would buy again. I was a little skeptical on ordering the teriyaki sticks version based on a couple of reviews but, I am happy I did. They were a soft stick as someone said but had a nice crunch when you bit in. The teriyaki was milder than others I have ordered and they were more smokey but they are called ole smokeys. I did not get the greasy mouth feel that someone said and it did have a pleasant tasting after taste. All in all, worth a 4* rating... but it could be a 5 based on individual tastes. These snacks are very different than, say, Slim Jims. They are moist and seems less processed than many of the convenience store meat snacks out there. There was a nice hint of spice laced with honey. I would say they tasted and had a texture that I might have expected in a more expensive product. I will buy them again and will recommend them to friends and family. I bought the Buffalo Bills Teriyaki Ole Smokies beef sticks because I absolutely LOVE beef sticks, especially teriyaki, and I thought this would be a good buy - good quantity for the price.The teriyaki beef sticks themselves were very tasty and flavorful. I also loved the texture, it was very soft and tender.The only bad thing Id have to say about this product is that it leaves me with a very greasy, fatty residue all over the rood of my mouth, which kind of takes away from the flavor and my ability to FULLY enjoy the product. Aside from that, I may still order it again. :) Taste great, once in awhile you will come across a pocket of fat but its worth the risk. Anything from this supplier is good quality and value. These beef sticks have a great flavor and the price seems fair. There is no label stating as to where this product needs to be refrigerated. Good kit, however using the F-pack (pear juice) made it WAY too sweet, I ordered two more and intent to blend the kits, the second two with out the added pear juice. I bought this kit after I really enjoyed making the tropical riesling from the same manufacturer.  It was equally easy to make, but it is very peary.  I wouldnt have minded it if it was more subtle.  Still very drinkable, but I suspect that Ill be mixing it more. This stuff will give you a marked energy boost. Note that every person is different.  For me, this lasted 3 hours before the crash.  (Not a sugar crash.) But my heart was pounding like it wanted to burst through my chest.So I only drink half at a time (like another reviewer) and it works, without the scary heart acceleration.Its even tasty. Out of all the brands of bully sticks, True Chews has to be one of me and my dogs favorites.  My favorite because they are not messy, they dont break apart as easy as some of the cheaper brands, and they do not smell!  My pup loves it because it doesnt make him sick, doesnt give him gas, and gives him hours/days of fun.  Their whole lineup is great and highly recommended if you have a puppy/dog with a sensitive tummy.  FYI My pup is currently 5 months old and is a 8lb Shihpoo.  I gave it one less mark only because they are one of the more expensive brands and that they are a tad hard to find locally. I was a little worried about the other reviews that said their wrappers were broken.  I wonder if they were pushing the wrappers they suggested (both suggested the same wrappers.... hmmm) However, the wrappers arrived intact.  In fact we took two packages camping and the left overs made it home without damage.  I detected no difference from the rice wrappers we buy locally at an Asian market.  Buying in bulk saved lots of $$.  There were a couple of wrappers - out of dozens -that had a few tiny air bubble holes in them.  It didnt affect the taste or function.  That is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  We werent wrapping anything that was really drippy so it wasnt a problem.  We will definitely order again.  Shipping was rapid.  A great buying experience. These taste very good, but arent like the BEST things ever either. In order of my preference (gross to good) with explanation: The \"rainforest\" flavor one is my least favorites (I dont recommend this particular flavor). has a weird cayenne pepper aftertaste to it (dont get me wrong, I love cayenne, but not in a cookie!).... The \"tropical\" one tastes as if corn bread was turned into a cookie version (not a bad taste. Really good, actually!)... the \"Original\" is very great. I forgot the taste though, but I remember liking it..... \"Alpine\", in my opinion, is the best - it tastes like a European type of christmas cookie. it has a chocolaty (carob) taste to it, but not overly-sweet. I bought a 40 sampler pack from the caveman bakery website. Its not exactly like a cookie consistency however the texture and chewiness of the cookie I like. They kind of remind me of like those natural nut and fruit bars, like kind or something. Of the ones Ive tried, Alpine and Tropical are my favorites mainly because alpine has hazelnut and tropical has a coconut taste in it. The least favorite that Ive tried is either the rainforest, it has a strong taste of ginger and Im not a fan of ginger. The other ones are pretty good too. However, I didnt realize that these cookies were so small, but I guess based on the big portions of todays society, this is a normal portion.Overall its good, would I buy again? Maybe if I was on a strict gluten-free diet. This may not be the best tasting thing I have ever drank but man do I feel instant results after drinking some. I would best describe the effects as very close to the good feeling you experience when you drink coffee. I notice that my circulation feels fantastic like my whole body is warm, a very healthy dose of energy and I dont notice any jitteryness like coffee or energy drinks give you.  The only reason I didnt rate it 5 start is because a 16oz bottle is $3.00 which I think is a little steep. But for the great feeling I get when I drink some I would highly recommend it to anyone else who wants to feel a boost of energy as well as a general sense of well being. Let me preface this by saying I purchased it at a local health food store for about a dollar less. I was pleasantly surprised with this drink. It tastes great, but definitely a little tangy. What I loved about this was how great I felt after drinking it. I felt awake and focused, and just overall really good. I will definitely be buying more. Good product! good price  fast shipping . needs an insert in lid to seal container better! I wish I found the plastic refill packs instead of 6 giant metaL cans - seems like a lot of wasted packaging.  I just didnt know to look for them until much later.  But, its much cheaper from amazon than the gocery store.  Probably about the same price as costco but no tax here and super convenient. And, the formula mixes well, my kid loves it and (most importantly) his poops seem normal...not nasty formula poops if you know what I mean! Alot of moms like me like this item because our babies have no constapation on it i love it very much. I rarely want to eat much when I first arise in the morning; but I do have coffee.  Ive found that these cinnamon graham crackers work great for me as a little something to eat along with my coffee.  They are graham crackers - not anything super-duper amazing - but they are nice, cinnamony graham crackers that are organic. I love the 34 degree cracked peppercorn, wheat, and other varieties so I thought I would try the caramel, cinnamon, and graham as an alternative to cookies or regular graham crackers. True - you can have a lot of these crackers for little calories/carbs, but the flavor is bland. In terms of satisfaction, they dont quite cut it for me as a snack unless I put peanut butter or something on them. They would probably be good as part of a fruit and cheese dessert platter, along with some peanut butter, fruit spread, honey, or cream cheese. Pretty close to the taste of a freshly opened coconut.  Id like to know more about the process for obtaining this water to understand what the \"natural coconut water\" means.  The tasty juicy bits of pulp in the product add an extra complexity and make this a very refreshing beverage.  The fresh coconut is jelly like and not so pulpy, but its still tasty. As far as taste goes, this is the best coconut water Ive tasted. I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isnt a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brians. Vitacoco uses Brazilian coconuts while Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brians use Thai coconuts. It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brians are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While Ive liked all the coconut water Ive tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps Im used to at some restaurants.The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G\">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brians taste the best, and Id have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if youre like me and dont have any coconut trees nearby, try this out. Enjoy! I had coconut trees growing in my backyard in Southeast Asia, and enjoyed drinking coconut water right from the coconut itself. Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water with Pulp is the closest to the real thing that Ive found. Received order within 7 business days.  The product received did not have the same label as pictured though the wording was the same.  Also the product did not have the same flavor as the product pictured (which we had bought previously locally).  I suppose the manufacturer has not only changed the label for this product, but also the recipe.  The distributor provided excellent service and we have decided to keep the sauce we received, just have to make our own modifications for our grilled vegetable recipe we have used in the past.  Thanks for another great distributor for the products we like.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZFQ\">World Harbors Jamican Style Jerk Sauce, 16-Ounce Bottle, (Pack of 6)</a> Its not great plain, but its wonderful mixed with other herbs.  It can be a little bland if you dont put anything but the rosehips in the infuser.  Hibiscus goes great with it, though.  Its a great tea for children because its mild and fruity, for adults add it to something else.Also, you can eat the rosehips after theyve been brewed, sounds weird but they are great, they taste a little bit like an apple and have lots of vitamin C.  Watch out for the pith (thats the best word I can think of for the little hairlike thorns that surround the seeds), though, if you decide to eat the hips.  Every once in a while you find one that hasnt been de-pithed properly, hence you need to avoid the pith if you eat the brewed hips. This mix is probably not something you would want to use everyday.  Its just new enough and different enough to be something special to add to your summertime recipes.  When you want to reward yourself with something fun and fruity, this can fill the bill quickly and easily.  It has no aftertaste so often associated with diet drinks.  I highly recommend it. I dont eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites. They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special. The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been dusted on. Some chips seem to have barely any flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most. Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes. I wish that these chips had more that just a \"hint\" of lime. I have purchased several herbs from Frontier which have been of good quality.  Thyme leaf is always one of the most difficult to purchase due to the likely chance of recieving more stem than leaf.  This thyme leaf purchase was of average to good quality.  I did have about 30-70%, stem to leaf cut in the package, so I was satified with the selection.  When I dry my own thyme leaf, I usually do about the same or a little less stem to leaf ratio for cooking use.  Stem of the thyme leaf are just as favorable as the leaf and can be used to cook with successfully. I like them as a midmorning snack with a cup of coffee.  They are also great for those mornings you really arent in the mood for breakfast, but know youll be hungry later.  They seem to keep you satisfied for an hour or two.  They do taste great - not too sweet and not overly cake-like.  Buy a bunch and keep them in the freezer until you need more. If you want a quick pick me up in a small package, each one individually wrapped this is my choice! I have one in the car mid compartment, and in my briefcase they would be great and a pre aerobic workout snack. Great flavor, moist & not too sweet. Beware if you are allergic to nuts-these are out. I took them out of the box and divided into zip lock bags and froze. When I needed more I just pulled one bag from the freezer and it worked out great. My kids (4yrs and 1 1/2yrs) love these cookies, much to my surprise!  The mini ones are just right for them and Im happy to give them cookies for breakfast!  There are 2 things I dont like:  1) The individual cookie packages are VERY hard to open...I always need scissors and 2) the cookies fall-apart easily...I wouldnt recommend passing these out in the car!Overall a great product and I purchased these in bulk so we are sure to always have them on hand. If you are looking for a rich chocolate cookie look somewhere else.  But if you are looking for a fairly good tasting 100 calorie breakfast or snack these are pretty good. Live with digestive problems, and you eat a lot of mint: mint lozenges, mint tea, and those curiously strong mints.  You can get tired of the taste of mint.  Especially in the morning.  I gave up coffee months ago, (and I still whimper some mornings), so Im looking for some kind of substitute.  Forget decaf anything.  Forget chocolate.  Forget tea.  Some people swear by hot water with lemon. I dont. Too acid.  This fennel tea sells elsewhere as tummy tamer tea. It does.  Its better than chamomile tea, which doesnt do much for me in terms of flavor or calming anything.Ive used this fennel tea in desperation those mornings when nothing else will settle in.  When even mint leaves or herbal teabags of mint leaves are too much, this goes down nicely.  But if youre not a fan of vegetable soup or celery, this might take a little getting used to. Me, I like it. The smell reminds me of hops. Packages came in soft container that had been crushed and one was split open.  I was worried about how fresh it would be but its aged so no worries.  The Mate is flavorful and strong.  I dont have much to compare it too but at $30.00 for 3 kilos (6.6 lbs) it seems to be a fantastic deal with a a good product.Not Organic, kind of a bummer, but pretty much expected.  I would get this again but I will probably try another more expensive, organic version and see if I can taste any difference. If youre setting out a whole can at once or transferring some of it to a container for later use, flip the can over and use a can opener to remove the bottom of the can. You can then pop the top of the can, releasing the vacuum holding the food in place and the whole thing will slide out cleanly. Much easier and tidier than scraping out the can with a spoon! My youngest cat goes insane over this stuff!  (Which is good -- shes the reason we had to seek out a new food that was for both adults and kittens.)  My older cat took a few weeks to adapt to the creamier texture, compared to her \"favorite\" canned food, although she loved the taste right away.  Once she got used to it, we started going through this case like it was going out of style and I had to buy more!  I have noticed much less smelly litter boxes since we got into this case, compared to many of the foods we use ... that was a big bonus for me, and enough to convince me to put this into our regular rotation of canned foods. Cat grass seeds will sprout very easily---you can sprinkle them on top of any kind of moisture retaining soil or peat moss.  My cats eat the sprouts very quickly.  I suggest that you purchase multiple seed packs.  I did so to insure that I would have more sprouts ready when the first wave was gobbled.  The only drawback is shipping cost--which is more than the seed packets themselves.  Thats another reason to order in multiples.  The shipping cost for several packages is the same as for a single packet. We have been buying Cat Grass for many years and this product is very well priced and works just as good as the expensive packages.Our Cats have \"Grown\" healthy and happy since they have this grass.Great Seller - delivered on time and product sold is exactly what we wanted and will purchase again. I planted this grass and in 8 days I had 3-4 inches of grass!The price hurts since youre basically paying for shipping. The cost of the seeds themselves are $1.59 as shown on the package. I couldnt find oat grass seeds at Lowes or my local independent garden center. Im hoping to find somewhere local to buy them so I can buy more seeds in the future without having to pay a premium and wait for them to ship. Great candy! Sweet and intense, low calorie and delightful. Made with actual coffee, not just flavoring. Fantastic. Reasonably priced too. Japanese sweet but strong black coffee candy. Lasts a long time in your mouth and costs alot less on Amazon than elsewhere. Made with real caffeinated coffee for a little energy. We enjoy these peanut butter and jelly bars.  My 5 year old with celiac disease says he can have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich again.  He loves to pack these for school snack. I tried these bars and they were very good, although I do like the Peanut butter chocolate chip bars better. The bars are a quick and easy to carry snack when you are on the go! These are good bars for being gluten free.  Not my favorite bar out of everything they carry but still good to keep around for a hunger attack.  If you really want to try something great try their Coconut Cashew Trubar.  Now, thats incredible! Its like you are being naughty but youre not! Wonderful! My son loves these granola bars! He has celiac and we wanted to try something different, these were a hit! Peanut butter and jelly together. How can you go wrong? It is great and without the worries of gluten makes it even better. It is cubes for our horses. They came in on time and the horses like them. There is not much more to say about sugar cubes. The fact that the title of this product includes the number 3000 is misleading.  Im not even sure what that number refers to.  I can tell you that it does not refer to the quantity of gumballs in the package (which is 850).  Its true that the product details stated the actual quantity of 850, but apparently I glossed over that fact.  The price is still a good deal compared to other vendors on Amazon; just not quite as good as I had originally thought.  Shipping took a week longer than expected, but I did receive and apology email.  The gumballs themselves were well packaged.I would buy from this vendor again (assuming that the consumption of 850 gumballs does not kill me). I really like this tea, but my husband smelled it and commented that it smells like Robitussin cough syrup.  The taste is more subtle than the aroma.  Overall, this tea tastes good and is a good value.  Its not the best tasting cherry vanilla or cherry tea I have ever tasted, but I would purchase it again. Tried this because it is 100% Kona and much cheaper than the other national brands I have been using. What can i say i am greatly surprised. Mild, no bite too it and no discernable acidity. This is on my shopping list from now on. This jerky is quite pricey for a 6.5 ounce bag, but its one of the few Ive found that is salty enough and doesnt contain a bunch of sweeteners.The smoke flavor is also pronounced.  Unfortunately, the price is the only thing that keeps this product from getting 5 stars from me. The product is great...but it arrived mostly melted together instead of individual drop pieces.  I am sure it was over heated in the shipping.  We live in central California where temperatures get into the 100s.  I am  able to use them, anyway, by just cutting them up.Partly my fault...I will try to remember to order during the winter months for cooler weather.Excellent product... I like the Dessert Delights line, and this is one of their better flavors. But the carton I received contains only packs that are stale. The sticks are stiff and difficult to chew, and the flavor disappears within 10 minutes. Im quite disappointed that they would dump old products on their customers. So far Ive tried all of the flavors and while there are some Im not over the hill about, Ive had pretty good experiences with them.This is one of the flavors Id purchase again. Im a big fan of anything lemon or lime flavored, so I had to give this a try. Ill admit up front that I havent had a key lime pie for years, so I dont remember the flavor like it was yesterday and this probably worked in my flavor. (I remember it in general, though.)This tastes awesome. I can definitely taste the lime and it tastes like what I remember a key lime pie to be. The lime flavor is there, but its backed up by a nice creamy taste that almost made me want to grab a few extra slices of gum. (Hey, its 15 calories a slice so I can splurge on this while I wouldnt want to splurge with the actual pie.) Unfortunately it falls prey to the same problem that the equally yummy apple pie flavor had: the flavor doesnt last nearly long enough.Ill absolutely buy this again, despite the flavor only lasting 1-2 minutes. I love Salt and Vinegar potato chips, but cant eat them on my low-carb diet. These pork skins are a wonderful replacement for those high-carb snacks. The salt and vinegar flavoring in the pork skins is a bit more muted than what I am used to finding in most potato chip brands, but is definitely adequate to soothe my cravings for a crunchy salt-and-vinegar snack. The pork skins are light and fluffy, with almost none of the hard rinds that can be found in some brands of pork skins. If the flavoring was a bit more pronounced, I would give this snack five stars. Wouldve rated 5 stars if it had more of a vinegar taste.  Overall, not bad at all, good snack cant find them anywhere where I live, so glad I found them here. Not too salty or vinegary just the right amount> thanks We discovered Earths Best when my oldest started solids years ago.  They had a more limited selection then, but offered more variety than the \"regular\" brands.  For him, we only bought a few jars each trip, those flavors that we couldnt get in another brand.  For our second child, we added a few more.  With the 3rd baby, we started out on the larger brands, but he wouldnt eat them.  Who can blame him!?  Theyre runny and lacking any flavor.  Not to mention, no matter how good sweet potatoes are, how many jars can you eat?  He gobbles up every jar of Earths Best without any problems.  When we introduce a new flavor, hes all for it.I agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny.  We just add a few tsp. of cereal and problem solved.Earths Best is more expensive.  I calculated that every 2 weeks of food costs me $15 more than buying the other brands.  However, we decided that since he eats it all (vs. being very picky with other brands) its a wash.If you want to use Earths Best for your baby w/out breaking the bank, try these tips:*Visit Earths Bests website and print off all the coupons theyll allow (usually 3), have family and friends do the same*Buy at Whole Foods.  They have good prices and when you buy a lot, they give you a bulk discount*You can also buy them by the case at Meijers for less than $10.00, cheaper than here! Organic foods are probably most important the first couple of years of life. That is when so much brain development is happening that trying to keep as much pesticides as possible away from your childs developing brain and body is a very worthy goal.Fortunately it is a little easier than it is for a grown up. With our more varied foods and time constraints and on the go, etc. Also no matter how worthy a goal, your child has to eat the food. This is an excellent combination of flavors that I was not always able to find at local stores. And with subscribe and save it is cheaper and delivered to my door.The flavors are vegetable turkey which lists the ingredients as Water, organic carrots, organic apples, organic ground turkey, organic whole barley flour.Sweet potato and chicken: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.Summer vegetable: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.Rice and Lentil: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oilThere are other Earth Best blends where water is not the number one ingredient. Obviously that somewhat calls into the question the value of this particular Earths best item. I just found the tomato and carrot one which I have ordered but not received yet.  Also if you put in organic baby food in Amazon search there are some brands with just food in them for example Peter Rabbit organics (have not yet tried it, but might when she is a bit older).Overall though I do recommend this variety pack. Our daughter likes them all and she is getting organic ingredients. And for a decent price, even considering the amount of water in them. The water being first in all 4 is giving me pause as to the overall value and definitely something I will keep in mind as to trying other brands going forward. The ingredient lists are all directly from the Earth Bests website, earthsbest.com,  as I do not have the products in front of my right now. My daughter loves these dinners. Theres no other organic meat option at my grocery store, so were stuck with this one, but I dont mind at all. I think theyre great. I agree that they are runny, but you can just thicken it with whole grain cereal, and problem solved (turkey dinner is thick enough).  I also dont understand why people complain that they are too sweet, or unhealthy. First of all, if you dont like the ingredients, buy something else. Second, I trust Earths Best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product. Third, the belief that if baby tastes sweet food, they will not eat regular food, is an old wifes tale. Are you people saying that you dont give your babies fruit and vegetables? They are all sweet.The only reason I gave this particular item 4 stars instead of five, is the price. I can buy it at my grocery store for 79 cents a jar. Here, they are being sold for over 91 cents. And thats at the sale price. If you buy these at the regular price, it comes to $1.41. Way too much! I love the thought that these baby foods are organic.  The shipping is quick, well packaged, and easy to open.  Baby likes ALL flavors so far of ANY type of Earths Best baby food.  However, this brand is always more watery than any other brand Ive tried. I actually cook most of my twins savory meals, but I always keep a package of these EB dinners on hand  for (1) feeding the girls on the go and (2) for those times when I just dont have the energy to cook or defrost whatever is in the freezer. The girls like most of the flavors, except for the peas. I wish EB had more variety packages with different flavor available. I purchased this food on Amazon then saw it at Babies R Us for 30 cents less per jar.  I like the product but AMAZON is overcharging! My baby has been eating this brand since he was 6 months. I like the convenience of high quality/yet not overly pricey jar food like this. It is easy on his stomach. Never had any health issues with it. The \"dinners\" are a bit more filling than the usual watery vegetable puree but it still does need a little cereal to thicken up. Summer vegetable is his least favorite. The zucchini (like cucumber) smells pretty strong. He would eat it now but when we first started, he hated it. My son loves the other 3 flavors and thats why I continued with my subscription since its more expensive to buy them separately. My 8-month old son is not the picky eater my first was. He had only refused one flavor of all the baby foods introduced to him in 3 months (and it was peas-cant blame him for that one) but he REFUSED to swallow the Rice & Lentil flavor in this variety pack. He actually spit it back out and then blew raspberries (cute, but messy). I tried several times over 2 weeks and got the same response each time. We will not be ordering this pack again even though he loved each of the other meals. My son really enjoys all these flavors- eats them all!!! Fast shipping. No shopping in stores. Great prices. Would recommend to all. This is great!  Organic baby food options - delivered to my doorstep!  The dinners are a good combination and receive a raving review from the bib wearer at the dinner table. 100% ground Arabica beans. Not my favorite, but not bad for a light/medium brew...smells WONDERFUL as its flowing out of the Kaldi machine. Smooth and not bitter, slight floral(?) aftertaste. ****Latest Update****We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...*********************My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months.  Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earths Best.  It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself.  The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy...  and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well.  All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased.Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read the review about BPA in the lids.  I spent some time trying to verify this myself.  A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldnt find anything definitive, heres what bothered me:  Clearly Earths Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids...  their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question.  The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss.  Thats only slightly paraphrased.  Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either...  nothing.  Im not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents concerns and tell parents...  something.  Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns...  just say something...  anything.  Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain.  Something, I likely wouldnt have done if I wasnt writing a review.  Their office was closed...  9AM - 7PM est.  Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.***UPDATED (old)****Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  Im sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but Im ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer thats readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least. Awesome baby food, I bought it online to save a few bucks, but some of the jars were broken when they arrived. 5 stars for the food, 1 star for packing and shipping quality. Earths Best Baby FoodMy favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earths Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. Ive tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earths Best is by far the best for your money.Fruit Variety PackNormally I would say this is a great idea, but I wasnt a fan of this particular variety. My son would have been just fine with it, but unfortunately for us at this point my daughter is allergic to raspberries and mangos. These are both things I think shell grown out of, but something you may want to consider when purchasing this item. I would suggest trying an individual serving of one from your local store to see if your child has an allergy, but if they dont I would say buy it! Other than that I do think its a great variety for kids who need some changing up occasionally. Also, the subscription price on this variety is great and can be altered depending on how soon you need it. We ended up running through another subscription we had and were able to have another shipped as soon as we needed it. This was a good buy. The variety is still close enough so i didnt have to worry if baby will like the next one I am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible. We used many of the Earths Best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them. What I found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were; I often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon.  Water is added to many if not most of the flavors. I wondered if that was a necessity however \"Plum\" \"Ellas Kitchen\" and \"Happy Baby\" brands (also organic) do not have water as an added ingredient. We definitely used these, but to be honest, I prefered the other brands because I felt we were getting a better value considering we werent paying for water in those packages. With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless theres a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earths Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earths Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what youre getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.Earths Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality Ive tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While Ive seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earths Best, its much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  Im going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but Ill probably always keep a few jars of Earths Best to get by in a pinch. I love getting this case. It actually saved me money by buying it this way...and my son loved the fruit varieties. I felt good about giving him this, because it is organic. The price is also good for the product. Liked the Baby food(yes for myself ;-P) really tasty and smooth consistency for an organic treat,except the Peaches and Apricots not soo much nice flavor and such.Really good though and timely shipping excellent buyer!! The flavor combinations are good and taste pretty good too.  I did not give it 5 stars because I thought the consistency of the pears was a bit thin and runny for stage 2.  That is easily solved if you mix the fruit with some cereal.  My little girl loves them. I have two indoor small dogs, Poodle and Maltese, and they have high anxiety, especially my maltese and these seem to help! Even if it doesnt they sure love em. My maltese before he ate it set it down and rolled all over it, I think he likes it! Id give it 5 stars but its just a little pricey. We have been looking for pesto that tastes as good as what we had in Tuscany. This is from the same region as our favorite. The consistency is just a bit runny. It has moderate chunks of garlic. It was quite tasty! I really liked this popcorn, and the price is much better than purchasing at a regular supermarket.  If you have at least a 1,000 watt microwave, it is best to use Power level 7 (70%) to start with, and set a timer for one minute until you arrive at the best power level and time for your particular microwave.  Otherwise, smoke or worse may lead you to believe this is a bad product. I think BJs has a better deal on mixed fruit packs by Gerber, but if your child really loves peaches, this is great! I found out about this spice blend in Dallas a few years back when I persuaded a waitress to tell me what the restaurant was using on the grilled shrimp.I like this Cajun spice for grilling fish. Recommend, but store it in a dry place and replace it every year or so at least, or it will lose its flavor. I have 3 chihuahuas and I thought these would be better for them since they are smaller than a full ear. They still were too much for the little guys. I would say a dog 20-30+ pounds should be able to handle them better than my 8lb guys.They had a strange smell and felt slightly oily to the touch. I dont know if that was something added to them to preserve them or it was natural.My chihuahuas are fussy and they liked them I was just worried about blockages since they seemed to swallow large chunks of them. They didnt have any problems and my 4lb was able to handle them I just wouldnt buy them again since my guys are too small. The bags were a good size for the price. I bought three and should have bought one bag.I rated them 4 stars since they were of good quality just better for larger dogs in my opinion. I actually, Gasp, tried this stew. I got to try this at the Texas Scottish Festival in Arlington earlier this year at the Caladonian Kitchen booth (then bought a few cans). The stew was quite good considering it comes from a can. Probably a fairer star rating would be 5 stars, if comparing just against other canned stews. Im not entirely fair though, because Im comparing it against stews Ive had at irish restuarants. So, I have had better. But, still a good product in its own right. I also liked the whiskey cake from the same company. Olives are yummy and a good diet snack, but I just cant quite give this 5 stars. Why?Because first of all, the flavor is occasionally too overly strong with some of the packs Ive picked up. I love the taste of chili powder mixed with olives, but sometimes the flavor just isnt as consistent from pack to pack. Im fine with some changes in taste, but some packs have it packed on while others have been fairly weak. This isnt enough to keep me away from this flavor, but it can be aggravating.The only other issue I have is that I wish that this was resealable. I dont often eat all of these in one sitting and I dont really like having to bring a second bag with me in order to seal up the portion I dont eat. It would be nice if the bag was resealable via a ziplock top or a small piece of adhesive fixed to the bag. I didnt deduct a star for this, but its something Id like to see.Otherwise this is a great product. The olives are always freshly kept in the bag and are of a good size. Theres no puny little olives here, which I like because its easy to get full when I eat these as a snack. Great Price, The best Maxwell House makes. It is a very good coffee for the price, less then $3.50 a can. Very good coffee.  Cant always find it in our local stores, so I order it thru Amazon every 3 months A 25% price increase since the end of November, from $37.28 to $46.65. Is it still a bargain?Now weve passed the $50 mark, which comes out to $5.57 per pound. I pay $5-6 per pound for fresh-roasted beans in five-pound lots.If the rating were just for the price, I would make it three stars. I gave these packs out as Christmas goodies, but saved myself one.  Delicious!  The gifts were well received also. We are trying to curb our carbohydrates.  The Wasa Crispn Light is a big help.  Especially when you need something crisp.  We have and will continue to order this product.  Thanks Amazon for selling this tasty cracker. I love oatmeal for breakfast, but it takes so long to prepare it and then sweeten it and add mix-ins that I usually dont have time. This instant granola is just about perfect. The only thing wrong with it is that its a bit too sweet. When I dont have time to make oatmeal in the morning, I throw one of these packs into my bag and make it when I get to work. Its also a great portion manager; it takes the guesswork out of how much oatmeal is in one serving. The cats love it. I could live without the smell and seeing the pieces of cut up fish in it but the cats love it.Wish I would have purchased more the price was right and it is good quality food for them. The Oriental Flavor Ramen Noodles taste okay but I almost always add ingredients to make the dish more wholesome. I prepare it by adding sesame seed oil, vegetables and water then adding the seasoning and noodles after the water boils. Rough vegetables like chopped onions taste better if they are boiled with the seasoning for 15 minutes prior to adding the noodles. I ordered and got this the next day. Planning to make vanilla for Christmas presents [...]). There were 70 beans in my package - THATSALOTTABEANS - I split it with a friend because I dont think I know 70 people who love to bake. . . On their own, they smell somewhat like raisins, but in the package, the smell is heavenly. Crossing fingers that the vanilla works out! but at what, 40 cents a bean, I havent lost much and the price is so much better than the grocery store, where I looked at 2 beans for $12. It is a lot of beans to go through but the flavor and quality is really nice. They are fresh, soft and very fragrant. I use a lot of vanilla bean because my family loves vanilla sauce and baked goods made with the fresh bean. You must seal these very tightly to keep them soft but with care, they will stay nice for months and you cant beat the price! One company sells vanilla beans in a jar and you get two or three beans for anywhere up to $6! And the quality isnt anywhere near what these are. I will continue to buy this product. Ive ordered these before and I am still thrilled with the product. I got the wonderful vanilla beans about a month ago. The first thing I did was to make vanilla sugar. Then I put 10 split beans in 3/4 cup mix of rum and brandy. I shake it every other day. Smells wonderful so far.  Im going to split a few beans to put on my stevia  which I use every day.  I also sent a pack of Madascar Bourbon vanilla beans to my 78 year old big sister but she \"freaked \" out.  \"What will I do with these?\".So far I find these vanilla beans luxuriously wonderful. Smelly, soft and tasty if you just take a tiny bite in your morning coffee. These have good flavor. Plenty of other reviews address that. I also like the thick zipper bag they came in. My only real issue with these is that mine grew mold. Ive never had vanilla beans do that before. These seemed unusually moist, so maybe that contributed to the issue. It started as a small spot, but grew so that it was on the ends of most of the beans. I finally got them all out, trimmed off the moldy bits, and froze what was left.It took 2-3 months for the mold to start, so if you use them quickly maybe that wont be a problem. But, I dont go through them that fast. Ive had beans dry out in the past, but this is the first Ive seen of mold. If you dont plan to use them within 2 months or so, I recommend keeping them in a fridge, freezer or coming up with some other way to stop the mold before it starts. My dog absolutely loved these, and he would have given them a 10 rating if he could.  Unfortunately he is nolonger with us, but he thought they were great for years, and this was the best price I ever found.  Very prompt shipping, and adequate packing When we lived in Omaha we fell in love with Pears coffee.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  For the price there is really no comparison.  Weve tried other flavors, but always end up going back to colombio supremo.  We are now on direct ship every three months with Amazon.  Try it.. its better than the grocery store options and less expensive. Prince of Tea brand teas are great. The premium oolong tea is good, but I found that I like their organic oolong to taste better than the premium, and it generally costs less too. Prince of Tea is a well known and environmentally concious company and youll do well to buy their products. Flavor 5 STARS:  First time I used the oil I poured some in a saute pan to scramble some eggs. It ended up being an earthy mushroom like flavor. I loved it.  I pour it on my dogs food occasionally and they love it.  I wanted to buy this originally because I watched the Dr. OZ tv show and he recommended ingesting a little every day for its anti-inflammatory properties.  I gave some oil to my Aunt who has an auto-immune disease and she likes the oil as well. I would definitely buy this product again.Ding for metal alloy container: It is cheap metal and though it was packaged well by Amazon.com the containers probably got dented in Amazons warehouse because it didnt seem like the packaging should have caused the dents.  The way it was packaged if there was any damage it would probably only be dents to the containers so I would say \"expect\" dents with any shipment of oils if this company uses the same cheaper kind of metal alloy for their containers.  Dents do not make the product taste worse so I do not worry about the taste.  I will return it if the containers leak but that would not stop me from ordering again.  However, the odds of leaking happening probably statistically is not \"often\" if you receive shipments regularly. If anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack, Doctor Kracker is an answer.  However, the hard crispiness is for people with good teeth. I am always on the lookout for healthy but tasty foods that are low in calories. These crackers are good, not in a \"omg\" type of good, but they have an interesting yet addictive taste that I cant really explain. I would definately recommend them. Everyone I give them to keeps asking me for more. I guess I should stop sharing. Purchased case of 6 cans from Amazon.com for [...]  bucks including shipping.Good quality slow cooking oatmeal. Good shelf life on cans. This is the slow cooking type 20-40 minutes depending on preference. Taste is good. I like it, it reminds me of food from my childhood. Not something Id eat everyday.  Kinda like the way I feel about grits. You need to cook them for a long time. How you serve them makes all the difference in the world.  Great for baking, but you have to know the product before you try baking with it.  Taste?  Real wholesome, good stick to your ribs food, takes some effort like granola. Healthy eating?  Yes. If you follow the cooking directions, in my opinion, you have wallpaper paste.  Cut the cooking time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes, and it is much better - a little chewy, but thats how I like it!  Breakfast takes more planning now, since its a longer cooking time than my old brand - but good taste and worth it. I wondered why my 10-month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews werent so promising.  Then I noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids.Heres the ingredient list: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Mango Puree, Organic Finely Ground Chicken, Organic Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Split Pea Flakes, Calcium Carbonate.Anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet, and this one is sweet.  The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - thats the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  Ive been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earths Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only. Of course its messy when a jar is broken, but I dont have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price. I purchased this product from B-R-US when it was on sale and my son seems to like it. I was scared of previous post of mold and I ALWAYS double check the food before I stir and serve. He seems to like it, but I recommend the Chicken Sweet Potato dinner. Let me start by saying my 7 month old son, who is used to my home prepared baby foods LOVES this, as a once in a blue moon convenience meal! Ive tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too. Rare in the baby food industry.I am following a weaning guide that I used for my daughter, and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland, watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made, healthy meals, resulting in picky toddlers and children. My daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet, and I attribute that to the hard work I put in in the first year. Another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs arent fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger.Id love to ask, who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets, though? My son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much \"fuller\", so Ive had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume. And it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water, so I add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little. Before long, Im sure hell just be on 2 full 4oz jars when I give him this.All that said, Ill reiterate, it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food, and I have no problem giving it to my son once in a while. I do recommend! The Earths best grourmet line is heavy on the protein. And as far as I know adequate protein is important for babies and they need, like the rest of us, good iron levels.The beef and spinach contains 5 grams per serving. You can check your cans, but most of the others we use the protein is 2 grams. Our daughter likes it. It is also the least expensive of the gourmet line and this is not something I could find in local stores. Recommended. We like to mix this with regular coffee because its so strong and rich by itself that it makes it go further and isnt too overpowering. Why is it so hard to find rabbit-based cat food??I like to give my cat variety in his diet; his main foods are mostly poultry, but I like to keep the fish and red meat to a minimum.  After my last cat was diagnosed with diabetes I did a lot of in-depth research on feline diets.  One veterinarian whos written extensively about homemade cat foods was fond of using rabbit as a poultry alternative because its closest to what a small cat would eat in the wild.  Its particularly excellent to supplement a diet when the cat is sensitive to fish (as many are).  Its also higher in fat than fish - many fish-based foods I looked at only took 15 to 20% of their calories from fat, and a cat needs more than that.This food fits the bill!  Its got an excellent ingredient list.  Its grain-free, which is what I consider to be the most important qualification, and doesnt contain animal \"meal\" or by-products.There are three reasons Im giving it four stars instead of five.  First, its expensive.  Rabbit meat, by weight, is going to be pricey, so Im not surprised...but just because I think its worth the price doesnt mean I wouldnt like to pay less!  Second, my cat isnt crazy about it.  Its got a ground texture and hes very fussy about only eating shredded meat.  I solved this by mixing a 3 oz can of this food with a 3 oz can of shredded chicken (of a different brand) and he gobbled it up.  I just wish I didnt have to take that extra step.  Finally, its awfully dry.  It was actually a surprise.  The meat itself is very dry, and the liquid in the can is totally separated.  I think most cat foods use thickeners so that the gravy clings to the meat, and this one doesnt.  Since one of the many advantages of canned food is that it helps to keep the cat hydrated - they have a low thirst drive and are built to take in much of their fluids with their food - I was a bit disappointed.  And surprised the first time I tipped what looked like a can full of meat too far to the side and ended up with watery cat food juice on my hand and the kitchen floor!  But this was also solved by mixing it with a chicken-in-gravy food.Those complaints arent enough to keep me from buying this food, though.  Its still a great cat food with a hard-to-find protein source and a good ingredient list.  Its a bit expensive for me to use as a main food, but a can or two a week gives just the right amount of variety. It is hard to tell most of the time if supplements work but I just have a greater sense of well being when I take this product. It really is a good source for essential fatty acids. I expect to keep taking it. As a gum addict, I was looking for a natural alternative to the artificial-flavor/artificial-sweetener varieties. This gum is great. Now, the flavor comes from real peppermint, so its not going to last as long as the fake stuff, nor it will be as mind-blowingly intense as some of the new super-flavored gums.  But if thats ok with you and youd like to chew something that doesnt put weird chemicals into your body, this is for you.  Its expensive, sadly, but what can you expect? Buying it in bulk here helps. If you look at the vast majority of sugar free gums in the store, youll see all kinds of nasty chemicals on the ingredients label.  There are a few xylitol sweetened options available online and at health food or vitamin stores.  Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that can safely be consumed by diabetics and purportedly PREVENTS tooth decay and has some other health benefits (research it).  XyliChew is the only brand Ive found that I can definitively say is NOT produced in China or sourced from materials produced in China.  XyliChew is produced in Finland.  Given Chinas contaminated products record the past few years, I would trust a product from Finland over China any day.  The gum itself has a nice peppermint flavor that does not last too long.  Thats okay by me, as I generally just chew this gum after a meal for dental health.  Its pretty expensive, but you can get free shipping and a discount through Amazons \"Subscribe & Save\" program.  XyliChew comes in other flavors, but the last time I checked Peppermint is the only one available through the \"Subscribe & Save\" program.**IMPORTANT NOTE: Keep any products with xylitol away from dogs; its toxic to them. The energy drink is a great product. The shipping price is crazy tho. I paid more for the shipping then both products together, so not a great deal. This is the perfect size for a snack bag for school.  Minus one star because the glue for the straws also glues the wrapper to all of the boxes.  Thats annoying. My dogs loved these...they were cheap too.  Only problem is they are oily to the touch...given they outside is great! I love the fact that this has so much iron in it.  Im a vegan and its not easy to get enought iron.  The molasses isnt quite as tasty as some Ive had, but it has about 5 times more iron, so Im ok with it.  I dont think anyone would buy molasses online if they just wanted a tasty food, so I guess its a winner. Wow, this tastes great, sweet and chocolaty! Like a liquid chocolate bar.Plus it is organic!It does contain high-glycemic cane juice, so I dont drink too much. The original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low-glycemic rice syrup. They have less sugar. All are organic.I dont know why the ingredients here say canola oil. Neither the Good Karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient. If I verified that this site is correct, and the Good Karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong, I would stop using the product. Perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information.This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.)This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralphs (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles.The 365 brand (Whole Foods own brand) is also canola-free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking. Only plain and vanilla flavors, though.West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body. They have a chocolate flavor.Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I dont eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere. I have been to New Orleans at one of the Pat O Briens and had there hurricanes and this mix can taste just like what you would get at the restaurant.  The key is  that the mix  makes twice as much as it says it makes, so if you go by the directions it will takes powdery.  So either use half as much powder or twice as much water, mix with your favorite rum(what they use), vodka or gin and a nice sweet hurricane. This hot sauce has an excellent taste, unlike most of Daves Insanity sauces. I put 6-10 drops into a bowl of mild chili to make it hot. Like the other reviewer, Id put it at about 1 million SHUs. Having eaten fresh bhut jolokia (ghost) peppers which are supposed to be 1 million SHUs, Id compare it to those.4 million SHUs would mean that the sauce is 25% pure capsaicin. That would make it prohibitively expensive to manufacture or consume. Reaaaly hot stuff. Way hotter than Daves Ultimate Insanity. Rivaled only by some of Blairs sauces. I dont think it is 4 million Scoville though..Maybe 1 million. A friend brought over a bottle as a gift and I loved it enough to hop on and write a review.Im just arm chairing this, but Id put it at somewhere in the range of 300K scovilles, or somewhere around half the heat of \"Pure cap\" or \"Mad dog 357 with bullet\". I tested the three side by side with a dab on the finger, dubious of the 4M claim. Maybe they mean it was made with 4 Million extract before diluted with the vinegar?The thing with all those superhots is that after a point it really doesnt matter. They dont have flavor, and you can always just add in a few extra drops. (I still appreciate the novelty!)Either way, it is aggressively priced, nice and hot, and unlike the other two sauces Ive mentioned, has a bit of flavor from the peppers and vinegar besides being simply being spicy oil. I like it!This is certainly going to become one of my regularly stocked hot sauces! It would go really well in a bit of soup, pasta, mashed potatoes, pizza, chicken wings, and so forth. this hot sauce is great im new to the extreme heat sauces but i have previously tried fear sauce which has 1,100,000 scoville units and this sauce is by far alot hotter just two drops mixed with a little salsa on my taco had my mouth on fire its unlikely 4,000,000 scoville probaly more like 2,000,000 but i would  recommend this product i got it for under 7 dollars shipped...  i wouldnt pay more than eight because your not getting much cereal. The company has been around for over 160 years, is the company that started PG Tips and started and owned Red Rose tea so you know youre dealing with a quality tea company. The flavor is very similar to PG Tips to me; but stronger. Its definitely a milk and sugar or honey tea due to its strength and youll be happy that the milk doesnt water it down in any way. With milk youll still enjoy the full tea flavor; the milk only enhances the taste. It is a very strong tea, so be prepared for that. Otherwise it is a high quality, full flavored tea at an economical price. PG Tips is still my favorite but since I cant find it in my area but can find Brooke Bond Red Label at my local WalMart Im a convert due to the quality and the very similar flavor to PG Tips...maybe its just me, but I taste the similarity.  You wont regret trying this tea! My brother Robert that he has purchased this exact product in this size from local Indian grocers in Houston TX and in Austin Tx area, including one purchase at a WalMart store in an area with significant Indian populations.  The tea was reported to be a wonderful product for iced tea with a faint pleasant flowery aftertaste.  He will purchase it again and again These Davids Signature Beyond Gourmet \"Bacon\" jelly beans do indeed taste like a very sweet and smokey piece of bacon. This is not flavor that Im going to snack on, but would make a great gift for the many \"bacon fanatics\" out there. My wife commented that with a little vinegar flavor added in, they would taste like PA Dutch Bacon Dressing.This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous \"Jelly Belly\" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E\">Davids Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> to review since my family loves jelly beans.I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.CFH If you are the kind of guy who really enjoys a huge slab of bacon with your breakfast, not that wimpy kind of stuff they serve at a restaurant, but the kind that hunters grab when they are together, thick, with lots of fat in the middle, you WILL enjoy these! You can almost feel your cholesterol count go up as you bite into them.Now I must admit I am a wimpy, crispy kind of gal, and I like my bacon on the lean side, in fact with my allergies I have to use Morningstar Soy bacon (dont cringe!). So when I bit into these, I realized from the very first bite I was NOT their intended audience.Nope, these are not \"girl food.\" They are man food. If you want to carry a bag of these out to serve to your fishing or hunting buds early in the morning, this is the perfect selection for you. However, you might want to consider the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLAMK\">Davids Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Man Mix</a> for a selection, or the milder and tamer <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E\">Davids Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a>. Both will give you a variety to try, just in case you dont like bacon as much as you think you do.I am grateful to have received samples of all of these from the company to try, and am basing my review on the samples which they sent. (Oh, I passed the rest of my bacon ones on to my guy buddies). This is a very tasty product.  This is my first time trying this, and I am glad I ordered it to see how it tastes.  As a product Id order it again.One odd thing though that will cause me to lower this rating from 5 stars to 4 is that the listing here says a pound, but on the label 16 ounces is crossed out and 14 ounces is written next to it.  I didnt weigh the container to confirm this, but if it is 14 ounces, then then they need to update their listing to show such.Since I consider shipping to not be part of a product review I wont lower my star rating for this, and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was SLOW.  I ordered it on June 20th.  A USPS tracking/delivery confirmation number was generated on the 21st to be fair, but it took until July 5th for me to get this.  Even taking into account that there was a major holiday July 4th, that just seems too slow.  Everything was packaged well enough (although without anything like a \"blue ice\" pack to keep it cold for summer shipping...) but just took a long time to get here.  I do suspect the order wasnt truly shipped until the week before the July 4th weekend, despite a tracking number being generated on June 21st. I got this product for my husband beause he loves Dr Pepper. It came before the date it was suppose to arrive on. He loves it he wants to drink it but he doesnt, he is keeping it as a collertors item beause they dont make them anymore. The item was packed good and safe and everything was there. NO COMPLAINTS! Shipping was quite a bit but the bottles were all unbroken and in good shape. Since Dublin no longer makes D.P. I wanted some bottles for a keep sake. These meet the bill. Over all good experience. I was delighted to find this product online, because I cannot always find it in the stores.  However, each package I have opened thus far is at least half reduced to crumbs because of poor packaging for shipping.  I doubt that I will order more using this method. These are the best tasting chips ever !  I cant get them anywhere here in Denver area so went to the internet to find them.  Wouldnt you know Amazon came thru !  Only concern is that they arrive a little crumbled---I guess understandable considering theyre being shipped.  However, not so in store, when I could still get them here.  Really grateful that I can get them at all. The chips are delicious!! I absolutely love them. They are very addicting. Excellent for people with gluten/wheat allergies. The only thing was that during the shipping process the chips became broken and crumbled, not as bad as I thought after reading other reviews but still quite a few crumbs in the bottom of the bags. I would order again. I make for my wife capuccinno in the mourning befor she goes to work.And I use flavored coffee in the esspreso machine and it is hard to findHazelnut flavored ground coffee at a reasonable price or finding just flavoredbeans. This 5pound bag from Coffee Bean Direct was an excellent price andthe flavor was very good also. A great choice for paople who grind theirown coffee beans. This coffee tastes like a good cityroast coffee with a mild hazelnut flavor.  Its good.  I am a big fan of hazelnut, and I would like the flavor to be a little stronger.My husband loves the aroma of this one and he prefers it to the Boyer Hazelnut because it is a little darker roast than the Boyer. This is a nice \"middle.\" Its a good-tasting roast coffee, with some hazelnut flavor. Id say it is as good or better than the Wal-Mart Millstone hazelnut coffee. More of the hazelnut flavor is often too much for moi.Its not the best coffee I ever had, but its just fine considering that it only costs about $6.25 / lb in the current market (Millstone is about $9).My only problem is what the product is -- 5 lbs. Its hard to keep that amount fresh, unless you are a restaurant. When a package is opened, I package the full 5 lbs in Wal-Mart (...) coffee bags, 1/2 lb per bag, then double-bag it into freezer bags, and pop that into the freezer. That way it stays fairly fresh, as defined by the aroma -- which is really nice when fresh, and less so when not Finally, an affordable flavored coffee worth drinking.Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut is a really smooth, medium roast coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor.The flavoring is not sweetened, which is a real plus, especially if you dont like sweeteners in your coffee. (If you do, you have complete control yourself.)The flavor is not overpowering, but is enough to let you know you are drinking a hazelnut coffee.Those who have complained may have received a bad batch. Usually the blend is good and roasting consistant, but, as with any other food product, variations and accidents do happen.I have been using Coffee Bean Direct coffee for about five years and have not yet received a bad batch.This one is a winner. We use this coffee at my office. People like it a lot and I feel good about it being organic and fair trade. Nice body and full roasted flavor at a reasonable price for a organic \"fair trade\".  Id buy the discounted pack again, but full price cost it too much to overcome my desire for an affordable coffee. I love Sleepytime tea at night while Im laying in bed reading a book, winding down for sleep. It has a fresh, comforting flavor, and a really great scent. It is a main part of my relaxing bedtime ritual, and I make use of Amazons automatic re-ordering program, which saves me So Much money compared to grocery store prices. I only gave 4 stars because after about a week of drinking it every night it kind of loses its charm. Thats when I alternate it with Celestials Tension Tamer, just to keep things interesting. Great product for herbal tea lovers, and again, a much better price here than in the grocery stores. I love Sleepy Time tea, I used to give it to my children, since it is caffeine free, as they grew up, it helped them warm up and fall asleep quickly.Just a little story and a small cup of warm tea, that was the routine especially in the winter. They are all grown now but I find that they are now serving it to my grand children and it is having the save effect.I still drink it between all the other teas I enjoy but this one is just a little more special. I love chi chis corn cake and I love that I can purchase it from Amazon. My local grocery store stopped carrying it and I was so happy to see that I could order it from Amazon. I would give it 5 stars but not everyone in my family loves it. (I dont know why, it is so yummy) It is a delicious side to any mexican meal! I had never made this or had it at a mexican food diner, so I did not know what to expect.  It is good and very moist, but if you use creamed corn with added sugar in it your muffins or corn loaf will be very sweet.  I will make my own cream corn to add next time instead of using Libbys canned cream corn which is high in salt and sugar.  I like sweets but this was a little over the top using canned cream corn. The first ingredient in the dry mix is sugar, not Corn Masa as listed on the Amazon site so be advised this is definitely a dessert. Ive got no talent in the kitchen but in todays economy hosts really appreciate guests who contribute to the atmosphere by bringing a side dish.  Id sampled this corn cake at a friends and couldnt believe it came from a mix.  I immediately ordered the mix from Amazon and put it to the test. So easy (water, melted butter and a cake pan) even I couldnt mess it up!! I took it to the next gathering where it was a hit.  I only wish it came in a smaller shipment (min. shipment is a pack of 12) but since everyone always seems to want the recipe, we can share. I really enjoyed eating this macadamia delights from Meiji. The chocolate has a great, and not too sweet, taste. The nuts are a bit small, if you are used to larger varieties, but that is a small problem.I found they were not good for my feeding frenzies. Stuffing a whole box down in about 3 minutes is not a good idea, as the chocolate can leave a bit of an aftertaste in the throat. Taken at a more leisurely pace, they are a real treat. The actual product deserves 5 stars, the reason I gave it 4 stars is because its like three dollars at asianfoodgrocer.com. Thats where I order it from, not amazon. Much lower prices. These are good sized seeds, and they taste good, not over roasted.  I know this as I rinse them before I eat them.  The flavor is a little strong for me, which if you knew me would not surprise you.  Im not the biggest fan on spices that add heat.  If you like Buffalo Wings, Im sure youll love these.  It was the \"ranch\" part of the flavor that caught my eye. It was this or a big tub of spice drops. These are better for diabetics. They didnt last long, and my wife enjoys the mess I make round the La-Z-Boy. The only thing keeping this product from five stars are all of the broken shells. At the top of the bag, I found a number of half shells. However, when I got to the bottom I realized that many of the seeds had collected there in a pile of shell remnants and seasoning salt. Blow the seasoning off and you may lose some seeds as well. Otherwise, a great eating experience. With Jack Links buying King B, it looks like they have repackaged the original beef jerky strips in this label with the same great results. I hope they keep up with the demand as everyone else finds them as I did.  Thanks for bring them back Jack Links! These beef jerky strips are really good.  Texture is just right.  Flavor is peppery, but also just right.  Could be more smoky for me.  This is a repeat buy on my part. Just like old style jerky.  Whole strips of meat, not compressed chips. Yum Yum. Peppery. This stuff is the real deal! Not too soft, not too hard, not too salty, no fat, and a great smokey flavor with just a touch of spice that makes your tongue tingle. For a commercially produced product, this is really a satisfying strip of jerky. I was pleasantly surprised and will definately purchase again... Over the past two years, thanks to Amazon, I have been sampling jerky from literally all over the U.S. I finally found a tasty, jerky that doesnt give my jawbone a workout. Great meat flavor, an excellent snack. These are great tasting and have good consistency and meatiness.  Easy to eat on the run (no mess). This flavor of Fancy Feast is decidedly the favorite of our waif of a cat.  She is usually a very picky eater, but this trout flavor really gets her excited.The local store ran out of this flavor and may not restock it, so I ordered online.  We got a good price and the case of food arrived in good condition.I was a little confused by the old label image that was on the web site that is just different enough from the new label that I had to double check that I was getting the item that I was expecting.It turned out to be the correct item, so all was well. I think 9 Lives does a better job on this variety than Friskies.  Or I should say my cat does.  Friskies doesnt look as fresh or as appetizing as 9 Lives, and my cat doesnt like it as well.  It just smells nasty and looks not quite as good as the 9 Lives.  I think they could definitely do better on this variety -maybe even add cheese to it!  My cat leaves this one in the dish but eats the 9 Lives version. This version is ground.  NOt my current cats favorite version, but he really likes the taste. I do wish theyd make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too.  My previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean. But, neither wanted it more than once or twice a month.  Why, I dont know but it seems to be a little richer than the others. I would have given this 5 stars but took one off for the high cost. This product otherwise is just yummy! This is spoken from the perspective of a diabetic who hasnt had regular taffy for years but I think this would hold its own next to regular taffy pretty easily.Its sweetened with sucralose, not maltitol so there isnt the worry of gastric upset which is the #1 reason I ordered it. I dont see why more companies dont forgo the maltitol and just use other sweetners that have less of an impact on digestion. The flavors are full and all different depending on color and yes even the dreaded bannana flavor tastes good.Its soft and chewy and I feel like I am \"cheating\" when I am not at all.I am glad I found this! This one is a great basic food. Whatever is in it, cats really go for and mine is no exception.  My current cat really doesnt like the ground variety which is what this is.  He will eat it occasionally, so I only buy it about twice a year.  My previous cat had to have it more often and really enjoyed it.  Its hard to judge what a cat will eat so if your cat likes ground, give this one a go because it really seems to be a big favorite. Ive always, ALWAYS loved Skittles! They are sweet and chewy, and they will give you plenty of cavities if youre not careful! ^_^Enjoy them, and buy this 3.5 lb bag today!4.5 stars. I love goat cheeses and buy them on a regular basis.  A lot of people seem unaware that there are many other types of goat cheese on the market other than the ultra fresh Chevre.  I have purchased this selection by iGourmet for both myself and for others as gifts.  The reactions from my friends have been mixed.  They all enjoy the harder chesses, such as the Goat Cheddar and the Ibores.  However, some people dont like fresh, soft goat chesses and one of the reasons that I send them this selection is so that they can try a variety of different chesses.  However, in the selection that I was sent it contained two versions of Chevre-type cheeses including the delicious Buche de Chevre.  Still, I wished they had more of the harder to find goat milk versions of cheeses traditionally made from cows milk such as the goats milk Cheddar and Gouda.As for as price goes, this is a surprisingly good value.  You are getting two pounds of very expensive chesses for a little more than I have paid for one pound of some of the varieties here.  One of my friends did receive a substitution for one of the chesses.  Instead of the cheddar they received the Cypress Groves Midnight Moon.  I can certainly understand why substitutions would be necessary and I felt that they replaced the listed cheese with an even better variety.  Overall I am very pleased with both the price and the quality of the cheeses, I just wish that they had less fresh and more unique forms of this wonderful type of chesse.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1423603680\">Goat Cheese</a> Someone grabbing a bag of Veggie Straws may mistakenly believe Veggie Straws are made primarily of vegetables other than potatoes.  In fact, a quick read of the back of the bag reveals they are made primarily of potatoes and flavored with tomato and spinach.  This explains why they taste so much like potato chips.  The texture is light and crisp, and while its been many years since Ive had pork rinds, thats what I think of when I bite into these straws.Sensible Portions is the name of the company.  A 20 ounce bag contains 20 servings, which is about 38 straws.  Each serving has 7 grams of fat.  Compare that to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0071BYOK8\">Frito Lay Baked! Ruffles Original Potato Crisps</a>, which contains only 3 grams of fat per 1 ounce serving.If you can overlook the fat content, Veggie Straws are actually quite tasty, and they do have that psychological edge with that name.  I feel like Im eating healthier, even when Im not. I have a fourteen-year-old chihuahua who is missing half his teeth. He has always been a dry dog food grazer who enjoyed picking out a piece or two of kibble and taking his time playing with it a while before he ate it. But he got where he couldnt chew the dry kibble, and for many reasons the canned wet dog food was not working out. This Bil-Jac Senior proved to be the answer. He is able to have the comfort of food in his bowl all day like hes used to, and he can actually eat it when hes hungry. I am grateful for this product because we are both old dogs who are pretty set in our ways. Ive had the other Nanas No Gluten Cookie Bars in Berry Vanilla, and they arent that good. But, the Chocolate Munch flavor is good. They are more moist, have a good flavor and a little crunch. The only reason Im giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly. I will be buying these again. I actually tasted the Berry/Vanilla flavor.  If youve ever eaten a fig newton, then try to imagine a fig newton, minus the fig center, with rice crispies mixed up in it.  It tastes a little grainy at first, but once I read the ingredients and realized that the grains were puffed rice, I was more at ease.  Really a good taste.  One of the better gluten free/casien free/egg free cookies Ive eaten. I have a 7 yr old w/food allergies and both he and my 3 yr old love these.  I have compared to several other cookie/snack items made with no dairy & eggs and I think we all liked these the best.  Definitely a must have for restricted diets. I have Celiac Disease, and I try to keep the refined sugar to a minimum, and I was suprised by how good these are! The light crunch is a shock at first, but is tasty. It is a tad dry, so I am only giving 4 stars. But the taste is great considering how healthy it is!! I tried the Nanas Bananas cookie bars for the first time this week. I love them! I dont have any gluten issues so I cant speak for that, but I really enjoyed the real banana taste of these cookies. Some people complained about the drier texture, which I will admit is a little different than an actual cookie, but it I always have it with something to drink anyway so the drier texture is not a problem for me. The cookies are nice and soft and there are little delicious crunchy bits in the mix. I bring them to work for a nice afternoon snack :) I will definitely be buying them again soon! These were good for a snack but found it a little expensive for the size they come in. I was excited to find Nanas line of gluten-free cookies, and have tried all the varieties that they offer. Of the various flavors and styles of cookies, these are my favorite. I find their individually packaged cookies (the large, round ones) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks. These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and its nice to eat a cookie that you dont have to feel dietary guilt over! A great \"hearty\" cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesnt have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nanas cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed. Probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it, because I have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the Nana cookies. At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isnt the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  \"real\"beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee. Our two Golden Retrievers have been on Beneful Weight Control now for at least 3 years. We didnt see any out of the ordinary pooping problems that others mention.  They love it and both have lost considerable weight -- both were considered \"obese,\" but now one is normal weight and the other is only slightly overweight.  My only real complaint is they stopped selling it (at least around here) in the larger 40-50lb bags.  Now you can only find these 31lb bags but the price is the same.  We go through about 2 bags a month, so its a little pricey. This tea makes extremely dark and strong tea on the 11oz setting which is my largest water capacity setting. I use the Keurig Iced Beverage Tumblers filled with ice and cant drink it straight.  My solution is to fill a gallon pitcher with ice, add some water, make two iced brew K-cups and pour it over the ice water for what I consider perfect iced tea.  You can forego the water for stronger tea, or add more water to dilute the tea depending on your mood or tastes.  This tea has excellent flavor, its just too strong right out of the Keurig for my tastes and in my opinion requires diluting.  Excellent for making a pitcher of tea! My dogs are very tiny and I needed a chew that would have the benefits of teeth cleaning but without any weight gain, and these did great, plus my dogs enjoyed them. If a dog doesnt like the taste and wont chew on a dental stick, then it would defeat the purpose. So these fit the bill all around. These Honey Stingers are great.  Ive used them a handful of times on runs lasting over an hour.  They do seem to provide some much-needed energy.  Theyre easy to chew, taste great, dont stick in my teeth or make me extra thirsty, and the packet is small enough to be portable.  I really like that the ingredients are pronounceable and healthy enough (organic tapioca, cane sugar, fruit juice, etc.).However, I dont see how theyre any different from organic fruit snacks (like Annies bunnies), which I can get much cheaper in a multi-pack from my local wholesale club.  The ingredients and nutrition information are virtually identical.  For that reason, I gave them just 4 stars. Heard about these from a triathlete who said that they worked fast.  An avid hiker, I have used other energy gels with limited success.  Taken about 15 minutes before an uphill climb, they provide the extra boost you need.  The chews have a great texture and taste like gummi bear candy.  Highly recommended. When I opened the package, I only found 11 packets of the Honey Stingers. There should have been 12. I counted and re-counted 4 times to be sure. The packets were in a thin cardboard display box, wrapped in a sealed plastic bag, and shipped in a sturdy cardboard box. I dont really want to go through the hassle of returning the item, so I guess Im out a pack.  Itd be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet! ;-) If you have been out to Philmont on a treck or as staff these are given to you in your trail meal. They are organic and made of honey. They good and healthy. A+ I have to agree with several other reviews here that state the \"The Switch Orange Tangerine\" is too sweet on its own. I ended up making a cool summer drink out of the can that I tried - served over ice & mixed with soda water. It was fantastic! The soda water/ice mixture helps cut down on the sweetness and improves on the refreshment factor.A little more about \"The Switch\"... The can claims that this product is 100% Carbonated Juice with \"No Sugar Added\" and \"No Preservatives\". One can is 8.3 fluid ounces and provides 140 Calories. Total Sugars per can are 34g; 36g of carbs. One can provides 100% of the daily recommended dose of Vitamin C.That being said, I cant see myself drinking \"The Switch\" everyday. Even without preservatives and added sugars this drink still packs in a lot of sugar in every can. Though to be fair, I rarely drink soda or sweetened carbonated beverages. Still, for a nice alternative to the standard soda I recommend \"The Swtich\". The Tangerine flavor is reminiscent of Tang. For those that want a more \"natural\" soft drink, this is a good option because it has no added sugars. It still manages to pack 140 calories in an 8oz bottle so dont drink this regularly if youre trying to lose weight. The taste has good complexity but like most fruit drinks, is a little too sweet for my taste. I would definitely drink this instead of a typical artificial orange soda though. Here we have a refreshing drink, not one youd want to drink three of in a row but just one for a picker-upper or to quench an urgent thirst.The flavor (orange-tangerine) is subject to peoples personal tastes but I liked it okay. Its not the best drink Ive ever tried but its okay for something different. People will have to make their own choice as to whether to buy it or not in regard to the price.Unfortunately, either the manufacturer, the Amazon Vine people, or both, goofily (is there such a word...? if not, I just invented it) placed two useless stickers on the can which covered half of the nutrition facts on the can. There was plenty of space to put them elsewhere but some non-thinker failed to use his or her marketing sense. So all I can tell you on that topic is that there is a 1% sodium content, total carbs are 30 grams, and there are 140 calories per 8.3 ounce serving (1 can.)I wouldnt buy this product but thats chiefly because I normally drink only non-sugar beverages. Not too sweet, not overly carbonated - can be best described as a good orange punch mixed with Perrier.  And while it is all natural, it is also reconstituted.And thats the rub, while tasty (tangerine is the most prevalent flavor with hints of white grape and a slight grapefuit finish), this is basically just expensive, carbonated juice.  Can size is the same as a Red Bull, 8.3 oz versus the industry standard 12 oz serving.Is more better? Not necessarily, but then again sometimes less is just less.  At approximately $2 per can, which category The Switch Orange Tangerine is, is for you to decide. This tastes great and I like that its more natural than most other sodas available. Basically, its a carbonated juice.  I generally prefer a larger 12 oz. size though. I enjoyed the taste... It is close to orange soda initially but then there is another sweet taste at the end of each sip.  But unlike orange soda, this is healthier and no added sugars.  Even though this product tastes like orange soda I think it would do well for breakfast.  It may even become preferred over traditional orange juice for children and for businesses that worry about short shelf life.  On the downside, the price is a little high for such a small can when buying 24. While Switch Orange is VERY orangey, it also tastes of something else interesting. Its fizzy (but not, in my opinion, excessively so) and tasty, and Id consider buying it. I seldom buy or drink soft drinks or sodas; I just dont care for all the fizz burning my nose. Switch didnt do that. Hurray!!! Hubby and I both shared the dring and we both liked it.  I really liked the fact that there was no added sugar in this drink.  Its a nice combination of flavors.  I found it a little too carbonated but he thought it was just right.I would buy it if it came in a larger can. Hence only 4 stars. I think this can is too small.  Too much aluminum thrown out.  I recyle everything but most people I know just toss it.  Otherwise I would buy this drink. I am not one for \"canned\" juice drinks, but this one was exceptional in flavor. I am also not a big fan of orange flavored drinks but the tangerine is distinctive and nice.  It kind of reminded me of one of my favorite soft drinks in the world, Ting (from Jamaica) which is made from real grapefruit juice. Very nice, if you need more Vitamin C in your life I would consider buying it. Everyone at my house, even my mother-in-law, enjoyed this drink.  It tastes very much like a quality soda, but is made with 100% real juice.  Small cans mean you dont consume a lot of calories at once, because although this is healthier than regular soda, you shouldnt drink too much -- its still a lot of sugar. Perfect size can and a refreshing drink. I think its proof that simple is best. This would be my first choice for a drink if I were out and about. I like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice lollies I used to eat as it has a similar flavour. The thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories.  I also found that the can needed to be bigger as I wanted more at the end! Switch definitely managed to keep its carbonated juice drinks intended flavor fresh. Though just a combination of sparkling water, the juice concentrates of several fruits (including apples, grapes and oranges) and, oddly enough, soy, it definitely maintains its taste of tangerine.Id love to see what other flavors Switch has to offer, with my only hesitation coming from \"natural flavors and colors.\" But, hey, Im willing to grant them a little leeway in that department thanks to the NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP! Its very refreshing to find products without sugar added, but make no mistake, this tiny can still packs a solid 34 grams of sugar, enough to give you an energy rush followed by the typical adrenal fatigue crash.  Perhaps you can sip just a few ounces every few hours to avoid the crash?The flavor is very good and will tempt you to chug the whole can in one quick drink.  Not exactly a health drink, but its a nice improvement over the usual junk sold as a soft drink. Nice alternative.  Very lightly carbonated.  Id say if a normal carbonated drink ranges from 80 to 100 on the fizzy scale, this ones about an 11.At 26 grams, its still a lot of sugar (mostly from apple and grape juice, I think).  Ill order a case just cuz I thought it was good and Im calling it 4 stars - but honestly, Id rather have it 50% splenda or stevia sweetened. After taking my first sip of Switch Orange/Tangerine, I raised a suspicious eyebrow because it didnt taste the way I expected it to. Then it dawned on me that my mouth was prepared for more of a fake, amped-up \"Orange\" soda, but what I was tasting was real, natural juice. Yes, I knew that from the label, but thats not the same as experiencing it.The taste was a nice blend of orange and tangerine, not too sweet, and the carbonation adds a nice touch. A bit like a non-alcoholic Mimosa cocktail.My only reservation is that the calorie count is (perhaps unavoidably) too high for me to drink this on a regular basis - though let me be quick to point out that this is a \"no sugar added\" product. For those who arent counting calories, a nice refreshing \"Switch\" from soft drinks! In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself. But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water? Thus was born...Soda Juice!And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E\">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C\">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G\">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40\">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54\">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used. Fruit Punch, Orange Tangerine, and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest calories, 140; Kiwi Berry is next, 135; Black Cherry is next, 130; and Grape has the lowest, 125.  Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice. All contain acerola, apple, and grape juice. In addition to their title juices Kiwi Berry contains raspberry and strawberry, and Fruit Punch contains cherry, lemon, and pineapple.  Orange Tangerine also contains soy.Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  The difference? The Izze products are fortified with vitamins: B6 and Niacin in addition to C and have roughly three fifths the calories, total carbohydrates, and sugars of The Switch products. I liked it!Didnt know what to expect.  It has a variety of fruit juices such as apple, orange and grape, but clearly had a strong orange taste.  I liked the fact there was no added sweeteners such as HFC or sugar.  Im not a pop/soda drinker, but I think if I served this instead of the traditional orange stuff in a 2 liter people wouldnt notice the difference.Its a bit pricy for orange soda and Im sure orange juice would be better, but if you are looking for something healthier, this ones for you. This is a very good tasting carbonated juice drink that makes a great alternative to soda.  There is not an overload of carbonation.  Just enough to make it taste more like orange soda.Its made with 100% juice (more apple and grape than orange, surprisingly), it has 100% RDA Vitamin C, its all natural with no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and its gluten free.The flavor of the drink I tested was called orange tangerine, and it was an 8.3 fl. oz. can, with 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar.The only reason I didnt give it five stars was that I really cannot picture myself paying for it.  Its rather expensive in comparison to the orange juice I buy at the grocery store, and if I want an alternative to regular soda I would go with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIR6C\">Blue Sky Jamaican Ginger Ale, 12-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>.  Now, THAT is good!  However, if youre looking for an orange-flavored soda-substitute THIS is your product.  100% juice; how could you go wrong. With the new fad of making sodas that are good for you too, we have plenty to choose from in the drink isle. Switchs Orange Tangerine has a great taste, a fruity nose and is refreshing. But with the same calorie content [140] as a can of Coke - well, Im sticking with Coke. Had Switch produced this product calorie-free like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00247D46E\">Nutrisoda Immune, Tangerine & Lime, 12Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> it would gain a greater market share with established soda drinkers. While Switch offers 100% RDA of vitamin C, the Nutrisodas pack on extras without padding our bodies. There is gum acacia in the list of ingredients.  Not sure if it adds anything to the flavor.  The orange and tangerine flavors do come through the fixx.  It seems to be a bit sweeter than orange juice.  Have achieved more satisfying and natural tasting fizzy juice drink by adding sparkling water to OJ. I _really_ like this drink.  My only complaint is that Id need to drink 2-3 cans at a time -- 8.3oz is a wee bit on the petite side for me.If it came in a 20oz can, Id be much more likely to buy it, and the packaging would be much less costly.Really tasty product, though, and Ive got no quarrels with the ingredients.  Yum. I enjoyed this drink.  It has a tangy citrus flavor which tasted a little less orangy than I expected, but was still good.  I liked the carbonation in the juice - it was about the right amount for me.  The drink has about the same calories as a regular soda, but I feel better about drinking it because of the natural ingredients.  The drink does not have the syrupy feel of a traditional orange soda which is a bonus.  This is definitely a lighter tasting, very refreshing drink.  The only reason for reducing the star value by one was because of the price which is a bit extravagant for me.  I recommend this drink. This is almost the kind of fruit soda Id make if I were going into this business. The difference is that Id go the Odwalla route and not use reconstituted juice concentrate and only use orange/tangerine juices. Since its a carbonated beverage Id probably use a stabilizer too so it wouldnt have to be shaken before drinking. That would result in a higher price, though not sure how much higher than the almost $1/can price its being offered as a grocery item (imagine the price in a vending machine).For this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice, then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice (a fruit high in Vitamin C and apparently popular in Puerto Rico and Barbados).  Theres acacia gum (as a stabilizer probably, dont want to have to shake a carbonated drink) and then additional natural colors and flavors, ascorbic acid and soy.My 13yo daughter and I shared a can and liked the taste.  On a par with Orangina. My personal preference would be for a little more carbonation, but this was ok. Im a traditionalist so I definitely prefer a 12oz. can, the quantity at this price makes me feel a little ripped, but then, I prefer to make my own lemonade in the blender adding in some raspberries or strawberries or mint to vary the flavor.  Cheers! \"No Sugar Added\"\"No Preservatives\"\"100% Juice Carbonated\"\"All Natural\"But it tastes just like soda . . .If you are a soda-lovers, but want a healthier alternative, this may be just the ticket. Its an especially great product for kids, because they really think they are getting soda, but without all the added sugars! My daughter thinks this tastes like Sunkist Orange Soda, my grandson likes it and drank the rest of it (most of the can).  I thought it was okay (by I am not a fan of orange sodas); I would undoubtedly like it better in another flavor, like Grape, or Fruit Punch, or Kiwi Berry.I think this is, of course, a much healthier alternative to any regular soda. And judging from my dautghers and my grandsons experience with it, it would be hit with most kids. 4 Stars is a compromise between my rating of 2 and my grandchildrens rating of 5 stars.  I thought the flavor was too heavy on the apple/grape juice combo and light on the orange/tangerine flavor.  Also, it left a mild, canned aftertaste.  But my 9-year-old granddaughters loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda.  It is 100% juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water, so it is much healthier for them than regular soda.  While it is true it still has sugar, natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks. The can I was sent contained 8.3 ounces which is a better size for them than a regular 12 ounce can of soda.  For children, this is a tasty and healthy alternative. Theres nothing wrong with this drink, but it really just tastes like any other orange soda.  Kudos to The Switch for not adding artificial flavors, sugar, or corn syrup, though.  It tastes pretty clean and refreshing, but a bit expensive for what it is.Dont let the small-sized can (8.3oz) fool you, this isnt an energy drink, its just an orange soda. I was really looking forward to this beverage, as I love tangerine juice and the thought the combination of orange, tangerine and carbonated water would make for a great soda.I have to say, it is different, but not what I expected. While it was different than a typical orange soda, I didnt find it THAT different, either in sweetness or taste. I probably prefer it to traditional orange sodas and I believe it to be vastly superior to many supposedly \"natural\" sodas, but I was surprised how similar it really is to artificially-flavored drinks. A bit more (maybe a lot more) orange and tangerine juice would be good. I have always been a fan of premium beverages and sodas. I will never buy Pepsi or Coke products. At a minimum I will by Jones because they use pure cane sugar. I really enjoyed getting to try this product, and I am actually going on now to start ordering it on a regular basis.You can really tell the difference between \"pop\" and juice with sparkling water. It is a bit on the sweet side, and I did not think they needed to add the extra juice flavors to make it just right. However this is a great product, good size for individual servings, and it arrived in good packaging by amazon. If youre a regular drinker of orange soda-pop, you might like this Switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage.  I thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated, not so fizzy that I had gas after drinking it.  At 140 calories per small serving, however, this isnt something I would regularly drink.  Its much healthier to eat whole fruit since its more filling that simply drinking the extracted juice, in part because of the fiber associated with eating whole foods.  Still, this is a healthier option for those who regularly drink sugared sodas. My impression of the Switch beverage was good overall.I was curious to see how good it would be.  After all, its not difficult to add some club soda to your own orange juice for an identical benefit at a lower price.The taste is fairly good.  It is heavy on the \"tangerine\" flavor.  Its a bit syrupy, with a high carbonation typical of many European drinks Ive had.The juices that comprise this beverage, in order of quantity, are:AppleGrapeTangerineOrangeAcerola CherryNeedless to say, I think it would be difficult to mimic the exact flavor at home, due to the mix of the 5 juices they have.  Overall, you probably will be pleased with the drink.  Certainly, the canned beverage is more convenient than mixing your own, which is impossible if you are on the go.I will probably be buying more of this product, however, I did not find the flavor to be so compelling that I would recommend it heartily to a friend. I am a die hard soda pop fan. I will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda (7up or Sprite) mixed in to kill the after-taste and to sweeten it up a bit.Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda. It has a crisp, clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after-taste. It is effortless to drink and doesnt make you feel sluggish afterwords. It is hard to describe other than to say they got it right. No extra sugar, yet it is very sweet, but not too sweet.I shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100%. We both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case!While I am not sure it could replace my Coke, it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake. The only problem (there always seems to be something) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz. I could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason I havent ordered more so far. I do expect to breakdown and buy a case, but I still wont be happy over the cost difference. This is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink.  Not too sweet or too sour & just enough bubbles to make it sparkle.  I would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch, if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice.  The only draw back for me, is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence. I enjoyed the flavor of this orange soda.  It was not overly sweet and the orange flavor had just enough tartness to it.  I am glad it does not have any HFCS in it, but the calorie count is still quite high from the natural sugars.  All in all, if you are looking for a good orange soda, try this one. This drink is very good especially after a long hot workout. It quenches the thirst without all the added sugars and preservatives. I highly recommend. This has great flavor, but I am not sure it would be a soda alternate.  I am thinking it would be good for a lunch or mini fridge at work!  Tastes great, but I really did not get the carbonation kick I get from a soda. Note:  I tried the watermelon-kiwi flavor first, and this review provides comparison to that flavor as well as unique information.Design/packaging:  I really like the can size.  Its narrower than a soda can, but the same height as a soda can.  It fits very nicely in my hand, and I could easily toss one of these in my purse or daypack.Nutrition:  The calorie and sugar count seems high on this drink, but if you compare it to the nutrition of the same amount of pure, unsweetened grape juice, its the same calorie and sugar count, plus or minus 10%.  (Its worth noting that grape juice is the first listed ingredient, so this makes sense.)  Thus, theyre probably not adding sugar or calories to the juice to make the drink.  The thing is, you probably shouldnt down ten of these a day, but one can as a snack or pick-me-up seems reasonable.Flavor:  Heres where Switch fell short in the Watermelon-Kiwi flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this flavor was refreshing and delicious.  It was not overly sweet like Watermelon-Kiwi.  Im also very impressed with the flavor.  Its like a less-sweet orange soda, except that its with real juice instead of artificial sweeteners.  I think this would be a great mixer as well as a nice snack beverage. I tried two flavors of Switch; the Orange Tangerine and the Watermelon Strawberry. I liked the watermelon flavor a lot, but found that with Orange Tangerine, the flavor of the can came through a bit too much. It reminded me of why Ive never really enjoyed drinking canned orange juice. Still, it was fairly good and the carbonation made it light and refreshing. Both flavors were a big, big hit with my 8 year-old son. I like sparkling water a lot.  Perrier is usually my first choice but sometimes I want something a little more then the fruit flavored seltzer water.  This drink fits the bill nicely.  It contains all natural fruit which is a big plus over the fruit flavored options.  It contains some calories but since it is from a natural source and not just plain sugar, Im okay with it.  This beverage is in a slimmer can with only 8.3 oz versus the usual 12 ozs of say, a can of soda so you save a few calories but not much.  It hits the spot when I want something sweeter then plain mineral water and its healthier then soda.Ive tried other sparkling fruit drinks with lower satisfaction marks.  Most of them claim to be \"all natural\" but list funky ingredients such as \"natural flavorings\"  Huh?  This beverage lists ingredients that are easily defined.  Also, it avoids the overly sweet taste of other  similar produts.  This one stands out as a winner but less calories would make it perfect.  I guess you cannot have everything.... We are big Izzie fans, but we were excited to try this sode. We were VERY pleasantly pleased. It is a very orange taste, delicious and it feels good to know there is absolutely NO sugar. So, when our children want a soda we serve this and they are delighted. Its a win/win! I repeat, carbonated fruit drinks can be too sugary. This drink reminds me of other orange soda brands without the extra sugar that combined with the metallic can always leaves an odd taste in my mouth. Orangina has a bit more flavor, but Switch Tangerine Orange is light and refreshing,. If you love orange soda but dont want to drink soda this is the perfect product for you.  This taste just like orange soda but is actually made of 100% real fruit juice.  no joke.  It really tastes good.  I loved it.However just b/c you dont have all the \"fake\" soda ingredients it still has tons of calories for 8.3 ounces 140 to be exact.  A can of soda has 150 for 12 ounces so I am not sure what the trade off is unles you want 100% of your vitamin C! Living in Germany for several years, I acquired a taste for Apfelsaftschorle or schorle for short, apple juice and sparkling water.  The soda water cuts the sweetness, gives the juice a little tang, and makes the drink a better hydrator; the juice makes the soda water a little more interesting.  I usually drink any fruit juice this way now.Switch premakes my schorle.  The blend was and orange citrus rather than apple, but very good regardless.  I tried it straight, but it would have been better over ice or if it had been mixed with a little more soda water and a little less juice.  The ingredients were juice, sparkling water, and a couple of stabilizers, without two of my pet peeves; artificial color, especially red 40, and high fructose corn syrup.I enjoyed it and can recommend it as an excellent alternative to conventional soda.E. M. Van Court No harsh after taste, no tangible negatives.  It just doesnt have the \"bite\" that I crave from other carbonated beverages like ginger ale or root beer.  Its a good option for a healthful drink with some fizz. I thought the drink was delicious, but too sweet. I mixed it half n half with sugar-free ginger ale and loved it, however, I rarely drink sugared drinks. You need to make a sugar-free version. I really liked the tatste of this.  It actually tastes like youre getting the juice from a tangerine...I think the carbonation gives it that zing taste you can only get biting into an tangerine, orange, etc.My daughter, however, really didnt like it.  Not sweet enough for her.I think its a little pricey, not sure Id be willing to plunk down that much for it~~the can is very small, 8.3 fl. ozs., which is a proper serving of orange juice, which makes it around $1 a can, or a little less.But overall I truly enjoyed that zinging tangerine taste!! Switch Orange/Tangerine soda comes in a smaller can than a regular soda (a little over 8 ounces, compared to the usual 12 ounces in a regular soft drink can).  It is labeled as \"all-natural\" because the sugars in it come from fruit juices rather than added corn syrup.  I chilled the can of Switch in my refrigerator overnight, and then sampled it poured over ice in a glass.  The color is not so \"neon\" orange as some orange sodas -- it is a softer orange color.  The fizz is also less than in a regular soft drink.I found the flavor pleasing, with none of the chemical or metallic taste which can occur in many brands of orange soda.  The soft fizziness of the drink complemented the orange flavor well.  I didnt really get a true tangerine taste from the soda.  Tangerines are a very acidic fruit, and have a very distinct taste, which I did not really get from this soda.  However, the taste is very smooth and quite refreshing.  My teenaged daughters and their friends loved this soda, and I have been re-ordering it every so often as a treat. Switch is a bit pricy.  You can cut down on the price by signing up for regular deliveries, but so far I havent given in to that temptation.  However I am buying it for special occasions, for the travel cooler, and for planned teen get-togethers. I certainly hope that Switch will be selling this product in larger packages - I was very disappointed when my Tangerine soda was gone - it was very good!  Actually tasted like tangerines, which was a surprise as most of the sodas on the market dont have much distinctive flavor at all.  Switch sodas are pleasantly carbonated, sweet without being overwhelming so, and very satisfying, particularly when drunk very cold! This relatively expensive convenience-packaged item is 100 percent juice and contains 140 calories worth of concentrated apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice reconstituted with carbonated water; acacia gum; some soy; and added vitamin C to provide 100 percent of the adult minimum daily requirement. There are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a \"natural\" beverage.I often mix juice with seltzer water, and I like the combination quite cold. The Switch Orange Tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what I am used to as juice flavor.The carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice, but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer.The tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda, but the orange and tangerine flavors dont last as long as soda flavors do on the palate.I would drink this again on a hot day if I could buy it inexpensively enough. This was actually a surprisingly refreshing drink that is lighter then OJ and reminds me of a virgin Mimosa. There was little after taste and the flavor isnt overbearing like an orange soda. The best thing is its all natural with no corn syrup. The bad thing is that the size is a little small at only 8.3 oz, which is probably to keep the calorie count down. Overall, a good, refreshing pick me up, but you may want to drink more then one. The can size is like a Redbull drinks.  However, its sugar content is 34 grams.  Attached is a photo of the nutrional facts.In terms of its taste, in my opinion, its quite tasty, sweet, a bit tangy and very orangish! I found this to be a nice alternative to juice and to the usual pepsi that I normally drink.It had a nice light flavor with just a little carbonation.  I dont believe tangerine is the right name for the taste. I would say a tart orange juice is more accurate. However, the name of the drink does not take away from the quality of the product.I let my children try a little bit of this and they too thought it was a very good taste.The cans are small, smaller than a coke can, but I found one to quench my thirst better than any of the caffeinated drinks I would normally pick up. Fruit juice has lots of calories, so at home, we often dilute grape or orange juice with water or seltzer and ice. We like the flavor and the bubbles make for a more refreshing drink. The Switch is a portable alternative - a little carbonation, nice flavor, more like tangerine than orange, and 100% of the daily requirement for vitamin C. When convenience is important, The Switch is a good, healthier alternative to soda. If you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar, then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda. The flavor is more heavily tangerine (which only makes sense). It isnt overly sweet, which is a good thing. If you like tangerine and you think you need carbonation, then I think youll like this product.  No sugar that I could taste to cut through the sourness of tangerine though there was a hint of the orange that helped take the edge off.  Of course if you really like tangerine, I mean you REALLY LIKE it, then you will get more than enough of it in this drink.We do need to be wary though of claims that natural equal healthy.  Is no sugar added really healthier?  What about the carbonate process that adds the fizzle and bubbles, what are those health affects if any?  Much like claims of organic we need to remember that not everything in nature is good for every person.  There is still a nice chunk of calories here, far more than water.  If you are allergic to citrus you shouldnt drink this even though you might drink things like Sunkisk.Did it taste good, oh yeah, it did to me because I like tangerine and orange.  But it did also have a slightly sour after taste that was annoying, easily solved with water.  Since I dont normally drink carbonated beverages though I felt a bit off after drinking this as well.This isnt just juice and you shouldnt make this a substitute for juice or fruit.  I dont doubt that it is slightly better for you thank other carbonated beverages though I think it would be better if they could cut some calories out as well. Switch is a fun alternative to traditional soft drinks.  Its 100% juice and all natural; it contains no added sugar, no corn syrup, no preservatives and no artificial color.  What makes it fun is its carbonated.  And just the right amount.The first sip is perhaps a little tart or bitter, but thats because most of us are used to soft drinks with added sugar, corn syrup and a bunch of largely unpronounceable chemical compounds.  Switch has none of that and, although different from traditional soft drinks, the taste is very refreshing.  The carbonation makes it a \"fun\" drink that you can feel good about consuming (it has 100% of the recommended allowance of vitamin C).Should Coke and Pepsi be worried?  Probably not, but it does taste good and its actually good for you.  You should try it! Ill admit that I dont care for drinks that are carbonated - the carbonation in soda makes me burp, they tend to be too sweet, or the diet drinks have a weird taste to them. So I wasnt sure what to expect when I drank this.To my surprise, the carbonation is very mild - its more like a light buzz in your mouth instead of a lot of carbonation (you wont hear the contents fizz when you drink this stuff). The orange tangerine flavor is a nice combo  - stronger in the tangerine flavor than orange, though as someone who doesnt like any sugar in my drinks, I found it to be a tad sweet (though it is advertised as no sugar added), but less than I expected.Im not sure when you would drink this though - its a small can and I cant imagine someone who drinks cans of soda drinking one of these instead - especially at the price they charge for this. Are they thinking that this will replace a glass of orange juice first thing in the morning?Overall I think its tasty and if someone offered me one, Id take it, but its not something I would buy. This is a mix of apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juices.Taste is obviously subjective and that can be seen in the reviews. I like the flavor but will try to describe it rather than raving or ranting about it.The tangerine is the dominant flavor. However it is the taste of a very ripe tangerine or, perhaps, a clementine. There is that slight alcohol or medicinal overtone to an otherwise good flavor. I could see people not liking it while other do.Each can has 34 grams of sugar, 100 vitamin C, and 20% vitamin A and not much else. These arent nutrients that are otherwise hard to get so this isnt necessarily a healthy alternative to regular soda. On some level (e.g. producing fruit instead of sugar cane) it might be attractive to some. This was a very interesting drink! It was refreshing, tasty and healthy! It was very Tangerine tasting, no after taste and very refreshing! I decided to try \"The Switch\" orange tangerine because it was promoted as a drink that is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all-natural and it happens to be carbonated.The taste is like drinking orange juice at first with carbonation and I have to be truthful, at first I wondered if it was an alcoholic beverage at first.But after tasting it, you do taste the combination of the orange tangerine and the carbonation.The drink contains no sugar or corn syrup and no preservatives.Overall, a tasty carbonated beverage with only 140 calories and no fat.  15mg of sodium and 36g of carbs.If you are interested in the beverage that combines the taste of juice and carbonation, give \"Switch\" a try! I enjoyed this drink. It has good fizz and flavor. Ingredients include apple/grade juices as the main fruit elements. Tangerine, orange and acerola (type of wild cherry) round out the other fruit juices. For my taste, this is not citrusy enough. I find an Orangina to have better flavor, but it is loaded with added sugars (high fructose corn syrup is the second ingredient in Orangina)! I also compare this to the Izze version and the Izze wins for flavor. I think the health benefits of The Switch or Izze drinks outweigh the flavor differences though, and if I was but one of these types of drinks, I would not look at Orangina again. Orange Tangerine Switch is a crisp carbonated citrus beverage. Unlike its sugar-laden brethren, Switch doesnt leave a sticky film in your mouth after youve finished drinking it, presumably because there isnt any sugar added to the drink. My only complaint is the price: at about $1 per can, you dont get a whole lot of bang for your buck, especially since you can get a 12-oz can of regular soda for a much lower price.  I guess thats the price you pay for something thats \"better\" for you. As part of Amazons Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E\">Black Cherry</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O\">Orange Tangerine</a>. I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and theres no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends Ive tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW\">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice</a>, for example.The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switchs blend is as flavorful as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWQ\">essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4\">San Pellegrino Orange</a> although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9GB4Y\">Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda</a>, which has 170 calories per bottle. Theres a low calorie (10) version as well but it isnt available on Amazon. ...and youll have a pretty good idea what this tastes like. The tangerine (and/or the added flavoring) provides a nice tang to the flavor. I found it to be quite tasty and refreshing.  Im not sure why they are packaging it in the small 8.3 oz \"energy drink\"-size cans, unless its to keep the calories per serving down. At 140 cal.can, it certainly isnt low-cal, but there is no added HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) or sugar. The surprisingly high price is also a downside. True, real juice is a lot more expensive than water and HFCS, but at this price, Ill give it a pass.Pros:Good taste, not too carbonatedCons:Small can, expensive, fairly high calorie/oz Overall, this is a nice, light, refreshing drink. The sweetness is a bit sweeter than Juice Squeeze, but not as sweet as Hansens soda. I tried two flavors: this orange tangerine, and the strawberry watermelon. I preferred this orange one. The flavor was \"cleaner.\" But, there are so many different juices in both those drinks, it kindof gets \"muddied.\" I think I prefer Juice Squeeze because the flavor seems true-er. My 10-year-old daughter prefers Hansens, because it is a bit sweeter. But, like I said, overall, this is a very nice drink. No corn syrup. Yea! The Switch is marketed as \"100% of what you want, 0% of what you dont\"...meaning, the only things in the can are juice and carbonation. There is no added sugar, no corn syrup (high fructose or otherwise), no preservatives, no *artificial* colors (\"natural\" flavors and colors ARE added), and no gluten.The Orange-Tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated Sunny Delight - according to the label, the juice flavors are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. It was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation - almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape. It was light and, dare I say, refreshing. For what it is marketed to be, it does quite well.The only downside is that I could probably do something similar at home - buy some Sunny D and add some sparkling water or seltzer, and it would probably be cheaper. However, if youre out-and-about and need something light, tasty and not loaded full of extra nonsense, then this would certainly fit the bill. Taste is good enough to maybe purchase a 24-pack of this sugar-free, 100% juice carbonated orange / tangerine flavored drink. With more folks (like myself) these days seeking out sugarless soft drinks, this Switch product is actually quite good, I thought. Easy and small enough to carry. Might want to bring two. Ideal for a summer night outing at a theater in the park event, friends outdoor bar-b-que, kids softball game, etc. I havent seen this brand in cans before; how exciting!  I know this brand can be hard to find at the store so it is nice to see it being sold here at Amazon.  I am a big fan of 100% juice that has been lightly carbonated and have tried the few brands that are available and Switch is one of my favorites.  My biggest beef with the brand is that it is just super hard to find, which has now been resolved.  I have to say that I dont love the orange-tangerine flavor, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five;  I just dont really like orange flavored drinks but did like how this one had more tangerine flavor than straight-up orange.  I would definintely recommend this brand! A good drink, about 3 WW points. I mean its about what youd expect from an orange soda- expect its all natural, so you recognize the things on the ingredient label.Downside- really a lot of calories for such a small can! So far Ive only tried the Orange Tangerine flavor and its pretty good overall.  It does have a tangerine taste to it, though its accompanied by other flavors.  Its clearly much more natural than regular soda or those 10% juice drinks since its just fruit juice concentrates and carbonated water vs. the typical high fructose corn syrup plus artificial flavors, colors and preservatives in something like Sunkist.  I think the juice blend is appropriate for this type of beverage.  It does contain more apple and grape than tangerine or orange, but those first two juices complement the carbonation well viz a viz sparkling cider.  I think straight carbonated orange/tangerine juice would probably be a bit much.  The Switch reminds me of Appletiser, which is one of my favorites and has been around for many years, but is still pretty hard to find in the US.That having been said, I had to dock one star for a couple of reasons.  First, the cans just seem too small.  If theyre sticking with aluminum cans, Id like to see the standard 12oz size offered.  It seems like that would also have the advantage of making it easier to offer in regular beverage vending machines.  Alternately, 16 or 20oz bottles would also work.  The second issue is the price.  While I understand theres a huge difference between the cost of real juice and artificially flavored corn syrup, the current price still seems high, even in comparison to other juice drinks.  That might be partly because its from a relatively small company that doesnt yet have the giant economies of scale that the likes of Coke and Pepsi can take advantage of, but it still seems like the price could come down a bit (or at least serving size could increase without a price increase) and it could perhaps still be made back up in increased sales volume.I pick up Appletiser when I can find it, and Ill likely do the same with The Switch, at least from time to time. Like many others, I found The Switch Orange Tangerine to be a little hard to classify. Its not too sweet, and not too tart, with a lot of flavor. But it distinctly tastes \"blended\" - creating a \"real\" flavor by playing with others.It doesnt really claim to be healthy, it just insinuates it in a number of ways. On the other hand, its not too overly sweet like a typical soda and I found the carbonation was just about right.Bottom line - its fairly tasty, but the small size for the price is a downside. Very refreshing!  Ingredients are 3 different fruit juices, sparkling water, and no sugar!  About 150 calories per can, and theyre smaller than regular soda cans.  So the ingredients are pretty natural, but 150 calories might be too much for some people! I realize that it is not quite healthy to guzzle 12-16 oz. canisters of liquid at a sitting, but this Switch Orange Tangerine flavored drink was so light and refreshing, and tasted so natural, that I could easily have downed another 8.3 oz can - or two. And that is the only reason this drink did not receive five stars - I wanted more and the little can was just not enough! It is the perfect size for a child, however - so perhaps that who the drink is targeted for. As an aside for those who prefer their beverages more adult-oriented, this Orange Tangerine Switch would make an awesome mixer with gin or vodka - cheers! Expecting something like Fanta or Sunkist I was surprised how smooth and subtle Switch is. Definitely a good combination of refreshment and flavor. Love the fact that it doesnt tast too carbonated. The taste says fresh-squeezed quality fruit. The carbonation content is lower than some drinks of this variety. This ratio makes for a heavier juice drink. Though a delicious treat, especially with breakfast on the deck, I prefer to save a few calories (140 per can) and have more carbonation. As advertised this product puts only a small amount of carbonation in the drink.  The taste is similar to Orangina but with a much more pronounced juice taste and mouth  feel.  It actually leaves a thick taste in your mouth similar to when you drink orange juice from concentrate.  It is a bit high in sugar but at least it is natural fructose sugar from the fruits (again, similar to real orange juice) as there are no added sugars.  Certainly not a calories conscience drink but not bad.  I do think the can is way too small but then again any more and the sugars and calories really soar. Its basically carbonated fruit juice, but its heavier on the juice than a similar drink like RW Knudsens (the latter seems to never hit the spot). This drink is a great balance of fresh fruit taste, the right amount of bubbles and something like \"zing\". Very refreshing and tasty.Highly Recommended. These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola Juice Concentrates), Gum Acaia, Natural Flavors and colors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) and Soy. I was very surprised that this taste like a great Tangerine soda. Each can has 140 calories, 1orNo thanks I am  swimming from 15 mg of sodium, 34g of carbohydrates, 34g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C and 20 % of Vitamin A.I would be pleased to drink this sparkling orange/Tangerine flavored juice again. I found it to taste good and be a refreshing drink. But for my money I would rather by the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C\">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories. Im always on the lookout for sodas that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals. Switchs ingredients are: Filtered Water, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates, gum acacia, natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). It also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy. One can contains 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin A. It also contains 34 grams of sugar and it tastes like it.The taste of Switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has. I personally dont like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet. I can see kids liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda. 34 grams of sugar is a lot for 8.3 ounces of a drink. I would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids. This tangerine soda reminds me a lot of the drink called orangina but with a pronounced tangerine flavor. It is basically an all natural carbonated juice. It is very refreshing and pleasant tasting. Over all I like it a lot. Now, were not big juice drinkers in this family.  We take apple juice or cherry juice and mix it with unflavored seltzer water because otherwise we find it too sweet.  This is the same.  Its nicely carbonated, and it has a pretty authentic fruit taste, but its still too sickly sweet.  Cut it half and half with unflavored seltzer and a little ice and youll be happy. I really enjoyed this drink. The tangerine is very present and makes it very tasty. This drink is 100% natural and has no sugar added. The carbonation makes it a bit like a soda but a lighter and healthier one.I enjoyed it and I would definitely recommend it to others as an excellent alternative to regular soda. The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce can packs a big punch in a teeny tiny can. Touted as a healthy alternative to soda, I couldnt help but taste the similarity between Switch and Cokes Fanta orange drink. The difference however is more than plain. Switch is supposedly 100% carbonated fruit juice with no added sugars. It actually has a pretty good taste -- if it is all natural, then I think kids would love it. I liked the carbonation -- it had tons of bubbles and a light airy feel to it. All in all, I would buy this product again.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine This product is a light and fruity carbonated beverage.  You might ask how thats different from any other soda.  The difference is that this one leans more on the fruit side rather than the soda or sugar side.  I liked that about it.  While it was sweet it wasnt syrupy sweet to the point that it was cloying and it did not have a strong after taste.  Also it had a much more juicy aspect to it.  Its kind of hard to describe but the best comparison I can make is its like one of those fruity V8 juices only carbonated.  Maybe thats not right either but Id recommend trying this at least once.  It just may be a taste youll find youll like again. The citrus flavor is crisp and clear in this carbonated juice.  Its not too sweet, and the bonus of having no added HFCS or sugar is a winner.  The carbonation cuts the sweetness in a nice tart balance.  It is still high in calories, like any juice is, but I would definitely turn to this beverage over any of the manufactured sodas that contain added sugar, HFCS or preservatives. I really enjoyed this drink!  I am a lover of both orange juice and sunkist type drinks so I was very eager to try this drink.  It is the perfect combination of sweet and fruity!!!  The tangerine I believe helps give the extra lift of the sweet taste.  If youre trying to cut back on pop, I highly recommend this drink or even just for a refreshing treat! Im a big fan of avoiding corn syrup and a lot of the other ingredients that go into most processed foods and beverages these days, so this beverage idea really sounded good to me.  It doesnt contain a bunch of artificial junk in it, and it still tastes pretty good.  I could definitely drink more of these.  They wont ever be my favorite beverage, but then Im more of a non-carbonated kind of drinker anyway.  This is definitely a good alternative to other products out there, and Id like to try other flavors as well. I wasnt sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, its pretty darn tasty!To give you an idea of what it tastes like:  Take orange juice.  Give it the familiar \"bite\" of your favorite carbonated beverage.  Add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste, and there you go.  Basically, it looks and smells like orange juice, but it tastes like orange pop *should* taste, if it really tasted like oranges.  My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally dont let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that theres no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).My wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages.  Sadly, the sample we received was not enough to test this theory, but it should make a really, really good screwdriver. Switch is a GREAT alternative to sodas for our family! Love them and I dont feel bad about the kids drinking them.  Great variety of flavors! I just wish they were more easily found in stores. Seriously a great orange drink on par with Orangina without being super crazy sweet.  I have purchased this frequently since my first taste of it through the Vine program. Also! Goes great with vodka or tequila! Its nice to have a treat to give my kids that they feel like they are getting soda---they love the taste and I dont feel like Im having to compromise any quality .....I dont enjoy soda but I do enjoy this product and occasionally will grab a can--great product at a good price! This is the only flavor of switch I have tried.  It tastes just fine and is not overly sweet.  The carbonation is nice.  More importantly though, this makes a FANTASTIC mixer to use with vodka. Firstly, I hate orange flavored sodas. They all taste like ultra-fake chemical laden floor cleaner to me.  Switch is definitely NOT the case.  Finally an orange soda that tastes like real oranges and tangerines- who knew!  I thoroughly enjoyed this fizzy delight, which reminded me of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E3HLX6\">San Pellegrino Aranciata Sparking Beverage - 24/11.5 oz cans</a> but sweeter.  This, and ALL Switch beverages are highly recommended. I have tried a couple different flavors of this soda and found it to be pretty good.Its lighter than regular soda. All of the Switch drink flavors taste good and go down refreshing, but this was the one that made me skeptical until I opened the can. It does taste like fresh tangerines, and the flavor is bright and not weak or watery. Theres just enough fizz to add some interest, but none of the bad stuff people like to avoid in a soda: you know, artificial flavors and colors, preservatives and all that. Its just juice with fizz. In fact, its good juice with fizz! This was pretty tasty, but orange has never been my favorite. I recommend it if you like oranged flavored drinks. I absolutely love the strawberry kiwi. These drinks are not too sweet, natural and refreshing I will continue to try them. My beverage of choice is water and milk (and wine ;0) )...but for an ocassional treat drinks like these are great.Try them. I like this Orange Tangerine more than the other two of these drinks I reviewed previously: it tastes probably the least sweet of all three, but still a little too sweet-carbonated for me.  It advertises no sugar added and 100% juice carbonated and no preservatives, so I was expecting some sweet ~ this drink tastes like carbonated, watered-down orange juice, but its actually a pretty good flavor, and packs 140 calories, 34g sugar and 36g carbs in a no sugar added-no corn syrup- no preservatives-no artificial colors-gluten free drink!  I would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry, but I would also expect it to TASTE a bit more natural, and this one, like I said above, tastes like carbonated orange juice with tangerine ~ its nice tasting, but too much in the way of calories & such for me to drink this very often.It was certainly good, but for the tastebuds of someone who WAS a lifelong soda drinker (diet soda for the past 12 years), and gave up soda a year ago(I very occasionally drink a carbonated beverage now) this is not the drink for me.  I mostly drink water, milk, iced tea, hot tea & coffee now, and this sweet tasting, sugary tasting beverage, had way too much carbonation & flavoring for me!  The orange tangerine flavors were nice but still TASTED fake, which is weird for a drink that touts things like 100% juice and a label that says natural flavors...I would recommend this product only to those who like somewhat sweet, fruitie carbonated beverages...enjoy! I usually drink my soda room temperature but with this one I really needed it to be cold.  The taste is okay but takes a bit getting used to the tangerine in orange soda.  There was not as much carbonation which is fantastic as far as Im concered and it wasnt exceedingly sweet.  I would most certainly consider getting this again as I dont think its all that bad.  Its nice to have a bit of change from the usual orange soda flavor. The Switch Orange Tangerine is a nice beverage that is lightly carbonated and is made with real fruit juice.  Unlike most sodas, The Switch products are made with real ingredients (none of the High fructose corn Syrup) and it tastes great.  The cans come in a convenient 8.5 ounce can and theyre great for lunch or an mid afternoon treat,  If you want a light beverage thats made with the \"good stuff\" then youll want to grab a can of The Switch.  Do yourself a favor throw out the HFCS sodas and make \"The Switch\". The Switch in Orange Tangerine has perfect serving size to keep the sugar in-take at its minimum and naturally. The carbonated sensation adding extra awakening sparks to the taste buds!That was my wifes first impression.I like the \"fruit soda\" idea.  It maybe a better alternative soda if it is indeed made of natural orange, but it taste likes other carbonated orange flavored soda on the market.  The only benefit you are getting and not from the regular soda is it contains daily recommended 100% vitamin C. If the price is right, doesnt hurt to try. Ive now tried several of the Switch drinks. Theyre not bad, for a carbonated juice drink, especially. This, actually, was one of the better flavors Ive tried. Its got a nice orange juice type flavor that I enjoyed. Ultimately, these drinks remind me of Apple Beer, which is essentially carbonated apple juice. I love that drink, and think Switch could try an apple version of their product. Im sure Id love it as well...That being said, give it a try. It will quench your thirst, and Im sure itll do well in the marketplace. It fills a void where very few drink manufacturers have entered. The mixture of juices they use to sweeten this give it a little bit of an odd taste and makes it too sweet.  Its not a straight orange/citrus flavor.  Not being an apple juice fan I wasnt fond of it.I gave it four stars b/c it is what it advertises - its juice with sparkling water, unlike some other \"healthy\" sparkling beverages that are basically soda.For sparkling juice I prefer IZZE - its a little less sweet. This is a nice, refreshing carbonated drink. It has no added sugar, as advertised. But its name is a bit misleading. The \"Orange Tangerine\" also has some apple and grape juice added. The grape is not a great addition to the blend, so I wasnt thrilled with the flavor. The Switch tries to blur the line between soda and juice, and Id say that the experiment is successful. Its sweet and rich like soda, but it is, as the label says, 100% juice, and therefore of vastly more nutritional value. I guess it all comes down to taste, and its more similar to soda than juice here, maybe like a more toned-down Sunkist soda. As I said, I liked it, and Id probably pick it up again, though it hasnt displaced Squirt as my favorite. Much better than having to fight removing coffee grinds from a metal basket. I love being able to just toss grinds into the trash. These little cups are a perfect compliment to our k-cup varieties!  We use them for our coffees and loose teas.  I was not disappointed and they are much easier to use than the reuseable cups sold by Keurig.... These coffee holders are much easier to use than the others I have used and make life a little easier! Nice product.  Good company.  Only complaint is that it took over a month for them to ship it after I ordered and they never let me know what was going on. I just received my order, and happy with the ability of using some gifted coffees, I never used before, as I like my one cup at a time.  Only problem I have found is that the caps are sometimes difficult to get set properly.  I made up several cups with different coffees and store them with the rest of my supply.  Ill be back for more, and will tell my Keurig friends. I have been using the DisposaKups for about 2 weeks.  They are easy to put together and fill.  Caps fit snug.  I sometimes get overfill, but my Cuisinart does that with regular K-Cups.  I put regular coffee in it, Maxwell House, Community Coffee, sometimes I grind my own.  Coffee always taste just like in drip coffee maker.  Great replacement for K-Cups cause they have literally doubled in price in just 6 months. These fill your own K-cups are great to have and use with a custom coffee that doesnt come in the K-cup variety.  They are disposable and you can fill several and have them ready.  I also drink a herbal tea that I buy in bulk and now I can make it with my Kuerig.  Would definitely buy again to have on hand. I recently went to Hawaii and bought tons of coffee. It was such a pain to use the My K-Cup attachment on the Keurig machine because Id have to dump it out and wash it after every use. DisposaKups are a great alternative and work wonderfully with my machine! Its now super easy for me to use my own coffee! The only drawbacks I have found is that you really have to fill the filter all the way up to get good flavor. It leaks a little bit so the outside of the cup is a bit wet after using. Lastly, water moves through it a bit slower than normal K-cups so brewing a cup takes a bit longer than normal. I would still highly recommend this to anyone who wants to use their own coffee with their Keurig machine! These DisposaKups are \"the cats meow\" they serve the purpose thy were intended for very well and were delivered as promised on time and well packaged arrived in good condition I would recommend to all friends. I have the regular my K cup accessory that comes with the Keurig, but you have to insert the special holder and fill the filter each time, then wash them both out.  I like these because they are disposable.  And I can fill several at one time and have them ready in the refrigerator when I want them.  Very convenient. Love the product! I can now custom blend my personal favorite coffee blends, and get them CHEAPER than buying pre-fab K-cups! These work just fine after spooning ground coffee into a series of these cups (do it over a plate with ground coffee in a small bowl). Doing so, you get just the fine coffee you want and are not trapped by the standard selections. But theres no saving money: $14/lb coffee works out to 25 cents per cup plus the 25 cents per DisposaKup gives 50 cents per cup, about the price of regular k-cups. Darn! Hoped Id save money but I do get my choice. Great product to tide me over with my supply of Starbucks til they start making k-cups.  Easy to assembl and use with my own ground coffee. I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most. Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal. This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralingers.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it! This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!! Right now Im mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding. I dont know if its the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldnt find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but dont want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.Thank you for the personal, incredible service! One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didnt.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week. The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I. My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. Its exactly what you would expect...six packages of strawberry twizzlers. I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more. Twizzlers, Strawberry my childhood favorite candy, made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y & S Candies, Inc. one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States, now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company, the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie, they also make Apple Licorice Twists, Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists, I like them allI keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest Licorice Twist ever made measured 1.200 Feet (370 M) and weighted 100 Pounds (45 Kg) and was made by Y & S Candies, Inc. This Record-Breaking Twist became a Guinness World Record on July 19, 1998. This Product is Kosher! Thank You Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me. My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  Weve bought these many times from Amazon because were government employees living overseas and cant get them in the country we are assigned to.  Theyve always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner. I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM\">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasnt dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you wont be disappointed with. I love this candy.  After weight watchers I had to cut back but still have a craving for it. I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now, and I so miss my Twizzlers!!  When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than Im able to buy them right now. Product received is as advertised.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM\">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake, and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - shes the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees, you would never guess that theyre sugar-free and its so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free!  i was so impressed that ive ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so ill eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets.These are just EXCELLENT! I dont know if its the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!

Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.Thank you for the personal, incredible service! I have never been a huge coffee fan. However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and Iam getting one myself! :) This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.Staral Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCanns Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCanns regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand Ive ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.McCanns Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCanns instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!Thanks,Abby What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. Its still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient! I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter.  She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors.  Shes happy, Im happy!!!<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QW8\">McCANNS Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> The variety packs taste great!I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I dont understand why everyone on earth isnt buying this stuff up.Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You dont get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.Not sure why everyone on earth isnt this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap... McCanns makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. Its all good, thats for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCanns and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCanns is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so youll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if youre a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal. I have McCanns Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy McCanns Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent. We really like the McCanns steel cut oats but find we dont cook it up too often.This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing. Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldnt follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of. Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not \"burn your mouth forever hot\"  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us.. We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, weve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much. Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local stores candy. It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more. Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies! Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many. This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammers endurolyte product so its great, endurance athletes the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a \"salty\" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough. This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line. This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and youre set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy. For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasnt an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The \"zero carb\" sports drinks didnt help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!Ive shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work..... this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as Im concerned. Im probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin things. Consumed! Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think Im lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious! I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best Ive ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed. These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and Ive been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I wont order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up. These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!! i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp. This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  Im 30 now and I love it! I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but dont let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really dont think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on its own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you dont use any low-fat milk. Or dont add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great. We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems.I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping. My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know wont cause her pain. My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...its $10 cheaper and free shipping! Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergys and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didnt have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergys or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet. Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds. Îts a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!! I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance. This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him. This food is great - all ages dogs.  I have a 3 year old and a puppy.  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick.  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :) My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs Ive ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didnt have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it. This is the same food we get at pet store. But its delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less. Ive been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I havent had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs. My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. Hes been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, hed eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, youre actually getting more \"bang for your buck\" with the natural dog foods since you dont have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... Im sold!! Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. The cheap you can buy it anywhere food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets.  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food.This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved. My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  Its for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef). The mouth says, \"How do I love thee, let me count the ways...\"If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy. These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are! What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed. I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more! I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. Im going to order the six pack and Im a household of one. They wont go to waste! I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldnt believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  Ive got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!! Im presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. Thats how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, Ive always liked asparagus anyway and Ive enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! Its the best I can recall. Theres an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which Im looking forward to eating. I cant believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \"only 60 calories per jar!\" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!Gary Peterson I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctors office because it wasnt available elsewhere.  Im so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste. I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays \"CAFFENE FREE\".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it. this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... its clean, bright, fresh...great delivery...again quality... just try it... I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually dont get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday! I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try. Im Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldnt find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so its great to have them again. In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids! I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctors request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know hes eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just cant see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? Ill stay with this for now, but stay tuned.Im updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but hes just a big cat who doesnt exercise much, lets face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and shes so healthy. Shes tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. Ive ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it. I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his \"spunk\" so I decided it was time to start buying him \"real\" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and Im sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and hes now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals! I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select. This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesnt eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food. I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTIs under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  Its expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me. Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innovas manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters. My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I dont want to be rude, so Ill say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select! One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also. Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book! Ive been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and Ive never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken!  It isnt hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good! Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in. I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you arent used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough. Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you cant escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale. i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon The BEST investment Ive ever made for ginger. Its unbelievable! Its fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but its perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  Its very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  Ill be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :) Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger Ive purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling. I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down. My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him. I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried. What a surprise! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning. He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it. This product was a God send for him. Thank you all for it! I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them.Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!! If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  Theyre soft, easy to chew, and they dont get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend! Being a fan of Newmans Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas Ive ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They dont like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although its mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, its a steal! This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money. This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor. This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor & flair, Ive even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it! Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful. I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently its only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldnt find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy! What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will. Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely. <span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 0:26 Mins</span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didnt do a good job focusing on the tuna.I should film it over, but it doesnt look like many people view this product anyway. Ive never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning. these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to dress it up.I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!I believe a little heating brings out the flavor. I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I havent made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! Its dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. Its just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! Im going to try making fesenjan next :-) Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff! I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag. I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.Its much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bringback. Check it out. I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product! I couldnt wait to try the 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really \"takes the cake\" with size, price, quality and taste.The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldnt believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and youve got the perfect breakfast treat! One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.I will continue buying it. This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you dont need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.I will buy this product again and again. Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and its really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with. This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING! We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldnt discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it. This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town. We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores. This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. Ive also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. Youll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base. My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone. The smell is kinda strong, but not bad. Its tolerablel. This coffee is great because its all organic ingredients!  No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma. Like the other people mentioned, this coffee has a great taste. Ive tried different instant coffees before, but this one is one of the better ones. Another one of my favorites, if you want to try it out (though NOT organic), is Africafe pure instant coffee Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters. Love this product.However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging. These little guys are tasty and refreshing.I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.Theyre sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and theyre tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.This is a good bulk value buy and Id highly recommend the mints themselves.  Cheers! These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great deal.There perfict for on the go.Fifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary along.And there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugar.The price of twelve dollars was very resonable.Also there great for shareing.If you are looking for a mint try these ones.Youll be glad you did. Pros:+packaging, shipping, price+sold about a year before its expiration date (enough for me to eat/share 9 boxes)+not too \"fresh\" like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form. its a real mint!Cons: none! These mints are really strong and have a great taste. They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse. This is a huge supply of them. Im still working on these and have plenty to spare. Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 every time you want a mint. I love, and use the empty containers for medicine/advil in my purse, desk, suitcase. Also line with felt to keep earrings. Perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and LOVE the mints. Tiny and powerful without burning my mouth. Received as shown. My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them. It was great i could get them on Amazon. The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability. Its full, but compact.I havent run out yet, and probably wont for a couple months, but I cant wait to buy it again. I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much, I had to come write a review. The packaging is small for convenience, and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape, blue hue, and even more delicious taste in my opinion. I definitely prefer them over the regular-size Altoids and will continue purchasing them! Highly recommended! Fresh scent and taste. Easy to eat one tin in few hours. I use them as favors and everyone loved them. Hard to find the wintergreen smalls [sugar free] as stores only have the red smalls [peppermint --such a common flavor]. The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious. Driving cross country, if someone cuts me off, I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say \"Wintergreen Me!\" She pulls one out, puts it in my hand, and all is right with the world. we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didnt have to chew it to swallow it...This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And heres the kicker:After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. Were now loyal Felidae consumers.Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies. I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. Shes an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! Shes now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I dont agree with the previous reviewer that cats dont like it. Clearly, mine does. We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.  That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that wed give it a try for our cats.  Id had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really \"feeling better\" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, itll be more effective.However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life. I order these olives a lot. They are un-like any other olives out there. The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses. One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests. A friend whod been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago. Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound. At $7/lb. in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant, I think its great. Ive been drinking Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Lapsang Souchong, Assam, etc. Most of them were over $30/lb. with shipping. Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest. Has everything Im looking for in a strong, full-bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring. My current favorite afternoon tea. Unless youre extremely jaded or a tea snob, youll love it. I love strong, full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam, irish breakfast or early grey tea, but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging. So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasnt bitter at a more palatable price point, and this certainly fits the bill. And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another, i.e. iced vs. hot, this tea is excellent in both forms. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesnt cost an arm and leg. I drink this tea plain (without sugar or milk), and it has a pleasant aroma.The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store.  One reviewer is right, I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma.  So the label \"Imperial Blend\" kind of implied the herb.I am not exactly a black tea drinker, so this tea is a surprise, and affordable too.  I usually prefer White Chinese tea, like White Peony, but it is more expensive, and requires lower temperature water.  But this is black tea, and this aroma kind of remind me the softness of white tea. Ive tried a variety of Ahmad tea. Not because I particularly like this brand, but they are just easier to come across.  The Imperial blend, I believe, is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones Ive tried. Its full body like a good cup of Assam, which by no means overpower the delightful, clean taste of Darjeerling, complete with a long lasting note of bergamot. I enjoy it best in the evening. It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day.For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication. I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced.  I buy the three-packs as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly. My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too, try one box of it and you will love it too. This is an excellent tea.  One of the best I have ever had.  It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar. I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other.  Most have too much sugar or worst, corn syrup.  This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty. It does have a little kick. Enjoy. Might be a little spicy for some, but this stuff rocks. I use 1/2 and1/2 with V8 for a milder version , or the best is a Bloody Caesar!Half mix ,half clamato! Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste.  But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings. Since I liked it so well, I tried some of the others and I am now hooked!  They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time.  The Energy gives you that extra pick-me-up in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day, no matter how long. Im trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg), Organic Black Tea (600 mg), Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg), Proprietary blend (600 mg), plus some Ginseng (panax), Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, and Guarana. Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors.My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee. I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day. Ill be coming back to this one. i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does.  just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience. These things are huge! I love the way the crystals crunch, and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle. This lemony flavor is my favorite--its good on almost everything. Youll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this. This is the ultimate puppy food.  The kibbles are great for small breeds.  High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use.  Less waste results from the high quality ingredients.  I have been hunting, training, showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years, with multiple National Champions.  I have been highly satisfied with Eukanubas quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods.  My recent purchases are with WAG, through AMAZON.com.  Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock. A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste.In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend. Fresh,a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories. They taste just like chocolate pudding. If you like the Ceylon tea variety, you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea.I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good (cheaper than I can find locally).Highly recommended.NOTE: This listings description is confusing. Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams, which equals 1.1 pounds or 17.6 ounces. Ive been enjoying this tea for years.  This tea is good mornings, afternoons or evenings.  My local store went out of buisiness....Thanks Amazon!  I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot. Hi, I have to have black tea everyday. I have done it in the past 25 years and its a habit of mine. Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea. I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so :) I love love love this deal - its way fun to pick from so many! Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees. The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring - they do the choosing, and from a much narrower range. The sellers here are very nice, also, and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method (its easy). If you want great packaging, forget it - they ship fast, and the kups are just tossed loose in a box. Who cares? Once youve tried some random sampler packs (and now are overloaded with decafs,extra bolds, or teas), this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want.  Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered.  This was my second order and Ill be ordering this item again. good products and fast shipping equals a happy me. a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors...a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack. WOW!  This product is very impressive. I bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging, price and shipping.  The powder dissolves instantly.  Even in water!  Ive just been mixing a 1/4 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great!, but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next. This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries, especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away.  I think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well.  Im excited to add more of the SuperFoods to my diet in this fast and easy way. I definitely will being trying the other flavors soon. These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect. Although I wasnt sure about the peanut butter bar, it was excellent. I loved the Roasted Almond, Roasted Pecan and the Peanut Butter.I will definately buy from this seller again. Quick shipping and very fresh. Had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten-free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets. Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs.  Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking, too. Good product, good value. These are healthy and my mixed Llasa, Tibetan Terrier adores them. And they are healthy and his breath doesnt smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products. A great healthy product. A great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle, Rio. He loves the taste and it sure beats my arm. I really enjoy this product. I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store. Once I found it I look no further, its the only sugar I use.  Thanks so much. \"Sugar in the Raw\"(tm) Please Harvest Cane w/o BurningTo be delivered to: HC&SDear \"Sugar in the Raw\" folks,We who buy your product care about the environment. And wed like to know that you care too. When you burn the cane fields on Maui, it adds to the CO2 and worsens climate change. And the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers, your workers children and the residents of Maui.We love your product and want you to change to no-burn harvesting so we can continue to buy it, knowing we arent contributing to Global Warming and lung disease.[...] Love this sugar.  I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar. Recommend! Product is exactly as advertised.  What a savings!  At least half the retail price. Easy to store because of the individual packaging. This sugar is very good.  Use this in your coffee, cereal, etc for a week and youll never go back to white sugar, white sugar will taste terrible.  Plus from what Ive read, this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets.The product was delivered fast and well-packaged.  My only complaint is the price.  I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper.  I would be happy to buy in bulk, but this is the cheapest I have found. I really love this sugar and price-wise its much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else. Love this sugar. It tastes so much better and isnt as overly sweet tasting as \"regular\" sugar. Weve used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good. The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff. Great service! Items arrived faster than expected. Very efficient! Will use this seller again. I highly recommend this seller! Thank you for the excellent service! Please ignore the one-star comments, if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower. With anything that is gluten free you have to add another \"binder\" which is where the corn flour comes in. For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips, because they contain wheat (a key binder to any chip, cookie or cereal) this is an excellent product. My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious! Best flavor ever!  Im addicted!  They are all good but these are by far the best.  I could live on these!  And there is no need for anymore to say.... So many \"healthy\" products dont taste very good.  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill.  Ive had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty.  Ive served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them. Its also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway. I found these crisps at our local WalMart & figured I would give them a try. They were so yummy I may never go back to regular chips, not that I was a big chip fan anyway. The only problem is I can eat the entire bag in one sitting. I give these crisps a big thumbs up! This is one of the best tasting crisps I have ever eaten! I only buy it on special occassions because I know Ill eat the whole bag. I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so much--it saves me on a daily basis.  If youre trying to cook lower fat, healthier foods and in a HURRY, this stuff makes it so much easier.  Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird \"tin can\" taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever?  For some reason this product doesnt have that.  It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans, heat and eat.or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup.  I also make indian dishes with this, and spicey spaghetti sauce.  I also prefer this to most canned salsas, so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off.None of my local grocery stores carry it at all, nor do they carry anything like it.  So I have to pay Amazons inflated price to order this by the case.  I dont like that Im paying a higher price, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product. the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores. i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for $1. dissapointing! This is a fantastic product, and I wish it was readily available in most stores. Its taste is not the greatest, but its a 2.5 oz. shot, and its gone in a second. It tastes, more or less, like a concentrated sweet tea. For the record, Ive had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. Its got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I cant stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isnt horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I cant drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results. I have to get up really early to work out before work and I get super tired by the middle of the afternoon. I was drinking one 5 hour energy, usually extra strength, each day. It worked well, but gave me a jittery feeling, almost headachy but not quite. My husband got me to try this and I was skeptical, but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and doesnt give me that jittery almost-headache feeling.I dont mind the taste--it reminds me of the inside of a fig newton (mmm). And the price is ok, on Amazon anyway. At my grocery store they were almost $3 each, yike!And its organic--so I can feel good about it, right? Its all about me feeling good! I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there. He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day. Good stuff! If you want an organic energy shot, your choices are this one from Steaz and the assorted flavors from Guayaki. Guayaki Yerba Mate is actually in the Steaz energy shot and energy drinks, and they both use Sambazon Acai, so there are some similarities in ingredients.Great energy burst for 4+ hours on a Steaz Energy Shot, and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards. Plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work. This will help me cut down on my iced coffees, which are not helping my calorie intake.Already ordering 12-packs on subscribe and save, 2 per month. Great value. I was looking for a natural energy shot that works, and I found it. Steaz energy shot is my favorite!I recently had gastric bypass surgery, so tons of sugar is a no-no. And Im also allergic to Sucralose (Splenda) so most other energy drinks are out.I tried Bazi energy shots and they didnt work as well as Steaz, and definitely didnt taste as well. These have a taste thats almost like Coca-Cola--not bad at all.If youre looking for natural energy, give these a try. I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I dont like the taste of either of them! This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better. I like them cold for sure. My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we dont have to make stops for coffee! Especially on the turnpikes where its just way too expensive. Its worth the $[...] per shot. We normally split them. Im really sensitive to caffeine, even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but thats the same for coffee too for me. My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost. I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there. You can feel good about putting this in your body! Ill be ordering again soon for sure =) Ive been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon. As a software engineer, this is entirely unacceptable! So, I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market, for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the day.She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle. Over three hours after drinking whatever that was, my brain is still working at unnatural speeds. To summarize my experiences: I believe this works.She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it, which I personally feel helped the energy level. So if youre feeling tired during the day and hate coffee, give this a shot - preferably before you eat anything.Woot! Ive tried 5-hour energy, red rain, NOS, and other energy shots.  This is my favorite in terms of taste and effect.  Plus, its somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used.  Sometimes I wonder what Im really putting into my body with some of the other brands.  I purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years. If youre looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals, this is a great option.  The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters. I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market. I bought two bottles, which cost just under three dollars each. I fell in love instantly. The drink is delicious -- I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle.It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price. I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon. I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product, hah! I have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all, its also the best taste, others taste like medicine, this one has a tea fresh taste. I love it. I drive OTR...Over the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert. It has no sugar high & no crash. Im on a autoship which i like. The price is very good. Ive seen it over 2 bucks in the store. Products takes pretty good, and it doesnt leave you gittery.  With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below $ 2 a shot.  My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style.  I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink. I use this product daily, and it provides a steady stream of energy.  I do not get jittery or crash.  It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant. Ive been buying and drinking this for over a year now, and the energy boost is excellent, with a continuous, ~6-hour effect. The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well, or perhaps Im getting more used to it. I dont drink it for the flavor, but its not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other, non-organic energy shots. You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls!  The regular chocolate ones are good, but THESE are the BEST EVER!! Try this you might like it. I did and I am quite addicted, it is too easy to prepare, it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with. The price is really good and well worth the purchase. If you like this type of Couscous like I do, then give this one a try.It can be eaten hot, room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors, it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed. I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time. I will be back for more. This tri-color couscous is really good...full of flavor and fun to eat.  I love the texture.  I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro,) along with some red pepper flakes.  At the end of cooking, I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish...Highly recommend I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck.  So I decided to try good ole Amazon.com and selected this product.  It is so good..add a few herbs and its a great side dish, or add more and make a \"pasta type\" salad.so very good.  I am hooked.  Great flavor and so easy to prepare! I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon.  I like this so much that this my first product review.  I have to say that Im usually not a big fan of flavored coffee, but I thought I would give it a try.  When my husband started grinding it up, I could smell it throughout the house.  Sometimes with flavored coffees, the smell is there but the taste isnt.  However, not with this one.  Im now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try. I love this coffee. I do wish it came already ground as I dont have a grinder and use a blender instead. But its worth it. Many flavored coffees Ive tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesnt reach the coffee, but this one manages both. This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time -- Ive believe the company is local.  Ive been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it.  Im particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good.  I cant say that Ive had a bad one.As it turns out, its less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it.  Its a no brainer.  Try it, if you like rich, flavored coffee, youll like it. It is hot! I love it, tasty and a little sweet. I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot, but this one lives up to its billing. I consume about a jar every two weeks of this, either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip.  It is hot, but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me; I thought maybe Id cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera.  Its hot enough that people who arent used to it will say \"Thats hot!\".Flavor: bright and forward.  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me, I guess earthy.  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth.  I dont like to go hotter than this because the sauces Ive tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot (this happens to me with Tabasco sauce, for example).A drawback is La Victoria doesnt make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria, nor do they sell them in [...] or Sams Club.  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales. service was great, but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade :)Love the sauce - have yet to try the marinade Use frequently as we like to do Asian dishes at least once a week.  Love this product.  Fast shipping, as usual.  Would buy again. These individually wrapped pieces are delicious (although I wish there were a few more). Mildly sweet with no sugar-free aftertaste, even a traditional \"marzipan-aholic\" should enjoy these. Put this in my husbands stocking for Christmas and it was a hit. i love the convenience of the singles. The best creamer around.Taste is just like the big bottle. I can stick them in my purse and take them to work. These creamers come in 4 packs of 25. I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far, and havent found a single broken or leaking creamer yet. I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee, but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I wont allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup. I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping! Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers, I liked this item specifically because of packaging. I couldnt believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable. This seller is very nice.  And the price is very good.  The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free, and at that time he did not have it.  But for those of you that dont have to watch there fat in take, I would get this product from them. I purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee \"tea\" bags.  Theyre great because they dont require refrigeration. I found these new spring Pop-Tarts and bought them on a whim.  My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun, colorful, amazingly detailed artwork on these Pop-Tarts.  Fantastic for after school snacks, lunch boxes, and school treats. Tie with a ribbon for a bright \"thinking of you this spring\" gift.  The only challenge is finding more in stores.  Way to go Kelloggs - fantastic product! Yes, I am having a cup right now.  I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee.  I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money. Highly recommend. This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land.  It tightens up any dish; not spicy, just perfectly seasoned.  Its perfect, hence, my purchase of this 35 oz. mamma jamma. The order arrived as advertised. I have had only a few chances to use it, but it is awesome. The flavor is exactly what I hoped for! It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon, but I will definnantly order again! I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly.  Great quality, flavor and aroma.  Cant beat that its organic! Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months, and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat.  I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  Its great because I didnt have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldnt hesitate to buy this again. What a GREAT idea!!!! My daughter love it.I dont think is difficult to wash, I mean, is not like just toss water and thats it... but, come on!!!!Absolutely recommend it! I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didnt want my new baby to choke on.  I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething. It worked great for this, as well as for the food. I didnt like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean! I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding. When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good. I literally had to hide the box to the wedding! They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables. It was a great tasting product for the lowest price Ive seen! \"These are delicious! The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose. Crunchy and not bitter.\"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067AD4U\">Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Pounds</a> The product was exactly as advertised and fresh.  Unfortunately, I keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast.  We need to reorder to keep up with \"demand\" These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful!  The chocolate is very dark and rich and the \"bean\" inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing. Popchips are so good.  I have been following Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal.  These Popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence.  They taste so  good, Ive purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix (which is a great product, by the way).  This is the highest price Ive seen.  Whole Foods carries this item and its been on sale there for $9.99 (thats Canadian dollars, too, as Im in Canada).  Its even cheaper on Bakers Boxs own website, and theyre the company selling this product through Amazon. For a two-pack they should be charging $20 or less.  What gives?  I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices. The Sugar was sweet, that can not be denied.  As advertised, It didnt melt when baked either.  However, it will not do for your Liege Waffles/Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do.  These grains are smaller, think pretzel salt, or seed pearls. Thats exactly what I was looking for to bake some chouquettes (puffs with small sugar pearls on top). Works great, yum!! This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it. I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than Id original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid. Having always been a strict Peets Coffee lover, I was reticent to switch brands but Weavers won my heart!! The taste is clean and strong, the ethos is correct (organic, baby) and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate. Be still my caffeinated heart! Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weavers Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee.  And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they dont know better, take along a travel mug filled with Weavers coffee from home and enjoy a real Cup of Joe.  Er, Weavers. Im learning that Latin American and South American coffees have this distinct \"coffee\" caramelish finish.  As a Peets Coffee fanatics we learned that Weavers roaster was the roaster for Peets and we are hooked !  I already reviewd the French and Organic blend, but I must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink.Met the weavers team at the Warner Brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast.  Since them we are fans.You wont be dissapointed ! I like eating these whenever I need an energy boost.It has everything that I am searching for in a, \"To Go Snack\".Fiber plus Chocolate is never a bad thing!!! These are my favorite bars ever. The combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful! Very filling! These are hard to find in the stores. Im thankful for subsrcibe and save! My fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us dont carry them anymore!  Once again, Amazon came through and he couldnt be happier. I was buying Quaker Oats granola bars but these Nature Valley chewy bars are better tasting, they make a great snack when Im on the go. Chocolate, peanuts and raisins...it doesnt get any better. Hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school.  He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so.  It is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores.  So again, Amazon.com came through with a reasonable price.  Now, I came keep the husbands breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings.  I often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack. Green Mountain \"Nantucket Blend\" K-Cups make a very good cup of coffee in my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA\">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>. This is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK\">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] I generally drink in the morning.These are good on both \"Small\" and \"Large\" cup settings as well.Highly Recommended!CFH Green Mountain is my favorite brand. Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain. Very smooth flavor. Not too strong and not too weak. One of Green Mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion,love it for your everyday blend, perfect stregnth, excellent blend! This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup, the best I have ever eaten, with large hearty chunks of chicken,and vegetables and nice large noodles. This soup is just so full bodied, and is seasoned just right.  I am so glad Amazon carries this product.  I just cant find it here in Vermont. I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking,  I love the regular, I use it on everything. You wont be sorry you tired it, great for dipping bread and cooking omelet, and green beans. Oh my gosh, is this good!  Like most people, Ive been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it.  Then Hubby brought a jar of this home.  The tomato flavor is amazing.  I will never buy store ketchup every again. Sir Kensingtons did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product. The refreshed taste of this Ketchup is a great update, and now leaves me disappointed when Im given Heinz while out at a restaurant.For you Heinz die hard fans out there, this is not the ketchup for you. But for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in Heinz, be sure to give this Ketchup a try.Dont forget the spiced variety. Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go. This is ridiculous.  The best gourmet ketchup I have ever tasted.  It is pricey, but wow..love this stuff.  It would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup.  Yummy! The tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor.  It is clean and really fresh!  Perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich.The spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup I have ever tried.  It is so good I have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy! I have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years. The Roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchased from you are the best that I have ever used, including the mushrooms that I bought in Italy and transported back to the USA. I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms. They were mostly large pieces, re-hydrated well and had good flavor. Id estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.Im quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again. Highly recommend. If you are a peanut lover, these are for you. Much larger than cocktail peanuts. Six people on my Christmas gift list ask for these every year!! The cashews were nice and big, with the vast majority being whole.  There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag, but thats pretty expected with so many cashews.  They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle.My order took just over a week to arrive, which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country.  They came double bagged in clear plastic bags, and in two 5 lb portions.  This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with it.Great value for the price. I ordered these after a fair bit of searching online - even ordering the smaller 1-3oz bags. I will admit, I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good (or bad) the cashews would be...The order came in pretty fast - like 3 days. The cashews were fresh and whole - with like 10 broken pieces. They were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape.. first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal; considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them. The trick is to actually keep them in an air-tight box so that they stay fresh longer.The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt $5.00 for the 10lb since I bought them. These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty.  They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can. Got this free with another order I placed.  I couldnt believe how much the cats loved it. I will buy again for sure. This is a great ham soup base.  I have used it in Ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans.  Great flavor Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store.I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy.Just one small secret: Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one. I appreciate the fact that I can buy this product online and have free shipping. This is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture. Thanks again amazon. Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake mix is my favorite mix.  It tastes great, cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make.  Although it can be made using water, I think its better made with milk.  I love it with pure organic maple syrup. The pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my sons egg allergy.  Its also great for camping or any time youd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available. HEY! These are GREAT Waffles and Pancakes! We have to add 50% more mix, tho, as the recipies on the bag are VERY thin. But we have a lot of fun with this Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake & Waffle Mix! We serve them \"as is\" with fried eggs and REAL maple syrup, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002483TSQ\">Butternut Mountain Farm Vermont Pure Maple Syrup, Grade A Dark Amber, 1 Pint Jug</a>, or with warm strawberry jam and whipped cream, or Cool Whip, or add brown sugar to the mix to change the flavor and make a crispy waffle, or add 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup malted milk powder <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4HVC\">Carnation Malted Milk, Original, 13-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a>, for awesome gourmet pancakes and waffles like they serve at the Hilton! Its handy to have extra bags on hand, too, and you cant beat the Subscribe and save price. This mix is 70% ORGANIC, too! A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition.  Everyone get the munchies....is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips! This is a wonderful warm flavored tea, especially now in colder weather.This tea has a sweet,soothing chamomile fragrance. It is subtle and sweet.Its one of the better chamomile teas.If you find it hard to sleep at times, a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help.If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea.I highly recommend both. This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup Ive ever had so far.  The others pale in flavor by comparison.  There are only seven ingredients in this sauce, including organic natural mint flavor.  In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch, chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, caramel et al, because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale.  Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesnt overpower the flavor of the ice cream. There are only 110 calories.  And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste, I use it sparingly, so this 15.5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used. This is a simple product and it is simply good.  There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are.  It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup, so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out.  This will be great for people who like mint, it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate.  I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half, tastes great.  Sometimes simple is better. A grande item !  Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor, best  ever in a can for all purposes !  I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes, and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties ! I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon.  The Raincoast Trading Co. salmon is very tasty, equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland.  However, the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition, the Kirkland cans were dented badly.  I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon. This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant. Its much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way, with a lot of water and a bit of milk. This is very creamy and tasty. My only criticism is that there arent enough sachets in the box. Only 10. Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), its not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two. That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea. But its a delicious after-dinner drink! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box. i love this product cant find it locally. Sometimes little out of the way stores have it.But i also love the chicken,pork chop bags.Every store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market. This is the best way to cook a roast.  Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here.  Please continue to keep this product available! Its always a pleasure to find Frenchs products on the web.  All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasonings.This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find. If you like Oreos or the Oreo cakester, then youve got to try the Double Stuff cakesters!!! These are the best!! Side note: shipping was very slow, but maybe your chances will be better. I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this. But out of the can ready mix with a little salt, pepper, spinach, and some cheese and its a great easy meal! The thing about Marmite is that those who dont like it hate it, and those who love it cant live without it.  Its very much \"an English thing\" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in \"Victoria Beckham is Marmite\" meaning that those who dont like her...etc.).  Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price.  Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England.  The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didnt decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan!).  Good job, Amazon! Whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie! The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast. Hope these dont go the way of the dinosaur! I was not expecting to like these cookies as much as I do. I like chocolate chip cookies well enough, but I really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones. I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around. The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients. The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing. These are truly great cookies. They arent fattening and theyre good for you, right? Thats what I heard, at least, from an admittedly unreliable person. I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like. These chips have a great loaded potato flavor, which are flavorful. I like the sweet onion chips better, but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips. Kettle chips are great chips f/the money! After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which Im embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.I wouldnt hesitate to order another box of these once I run out. one of the best chips that you can buy...and ive tried all the kettle varieties, and many others.  Theres only a slight taste of jalapeno, and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone.If you like being addicted, these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous... The title says it all. Great flavor, hint of spice, excellent crunch. We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house, we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite, never enough bags to get us to our next shipment. I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save! If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself!!! WOW!  I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day. Kettle chips are the BEST non-baked chips I have eaten. I decided to try the sweet onion chips, since Ive never had them. I now have a FAVORITE!! If you like onions, this is a MUST buy! I will definitely reorder these, as I mentioned above, they are the BEST I have ever eaten! The flavor is GREAT. I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these arent filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC\">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which Im fine with since Ive a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I cant guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control. Now, I havent done a side-by-side comparison, but these chips still taste like the real deal. These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for. Portion control AND reduced fat? Yes, please!  With the Subscribe & Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store. These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.  The taste is perfect.  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good. I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor. These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips Ive had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as Im going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving). I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year.I love them,but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favorite.Will be ordering them. These are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips.  Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so its nice to find ones that I can eat.  The vinegar flavor is really intense and good. For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didnt think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors. What I like about them:1) Very thick chips.2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.3) Flavor, but thats a subjective thing.4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.Cons:As another reviewer said, theres a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but its true! And at least this way, youll get rid of some of the oil. These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many, a handful or two does the trick. Very crisp and savory. Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market! These R not too salty or greasy. Great crispy crunch. Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of. Every bag (after bag) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st!! Kettle chis are the best ever! These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but Im sure this is just a personal preference.Crunchy, real potato chips! These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste. Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning. I like the 2-oz size bags, just the right amount of chips. I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - theyre large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids! This was the best deal ever. The delivery was fast, the chips are delicious and very fresh.  Love it:) My husband and I LOVE these chips! Personally I think the flavor is perfect. Try them for yourself! The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard. This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or brats, chicken or just about any casual entree. I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  Ive found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that Im considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I dont know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting. As a professional potato chip muncher, I see these as thee very BEST on the market. Rich taste and flavor!! Almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.The true meaning of decadence! These are hands-down the absolute best Salt & Vinegar chips you can buy.  They have a great, strong flavor that has left me addicted.  These are certainly my favorite chips.  I highly recommend trying them! Oh, I love these chips! And theyre so hard to find where I am, and when I do find them, theyre usually $1-2 more per bag for less. Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon. I LOVE these chips!  It is a little weird to review potato chips.  But these chips are great. The crunch is just right, plus they have just the right amount of salt. Not to salty not too bland. They are a little oily but thats ok. The best thing is the 2 oz package. When I buy a larger bag its harder to resist eating them all.  This 2 oz package allows for a little \"portion control\". Be sure to use your scissors to open, cause these chips are packaged for freshness and dont open easily. Enjoy! Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss.  Some of their flavors are terrible.  But this is very simple and delicious.  Probably one of their best flavors.Pros: Thick, crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesnt compromise on taste, eco-friendly business that isnt just giving us lip serviceCons: The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open.  They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag.  Use scissors instead. We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation. I wasnt sure what to expect by the package, and at first bite I didnt know what to think...and then all of the flavors hit!Yum! They are a bit spicy, but nothing overpowering. Just lots of crunchy, sweet, spicy goodness. They arent sold everywhere though, Im still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live. I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive. I cant stop eating them!!! Its crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt. Just perfect!!! Believe me, some chips are so salty, I cant finish a small bag. But this one... I just keep on eating! These are some of the best chips that I have ever had... They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands. They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time! These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time! Im addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.As an Oregonian, Im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips dont have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\" These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands Ive tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing.These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.As an Oregonian, Im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips.

They are by far the tastiest chips Ive had and its impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag! These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but its the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.  Ive tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close. We are always pleased with Amazons packaging. Chips are never crushed or broken, always fresh. We really liked this brand/flavor of chips. Very tasty! These chips are some of the best Ive tasted. They are not filled with chemicals. You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. Not greasy. Perfectly crispy. If you dont like salt and vinegar tanginess, dont even bother to try. These definitely have zip. I love them. My children and their friends love them. Even my 4 year old loves them! These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor. Shipping was very fast, sooner than expected. fantastic!you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover I dont eat many chips, but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great. Expiration date is a ways away, so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet, hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee. I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I dont have to buy them from the store anymore. Bought this box of chips as a Fathers Day gift because Dad loves them.  They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips. These chips are quite tasty and the price is right.  Packaged very well, would buy again. For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska!..so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them.  They are very good chips! Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing.  I would order groceries online. I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat. We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and dont feel guilty eating them!  We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money.  We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery. A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , \"these will change your life!\"  While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips.  For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing!  The are the type of hot that is refreshing.  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you. But if you happen to, like me, there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip Ive found in this country. These are the best potato chips Ive ever tasted.  Its easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I dont know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips Ive ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  Theyre somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they dont skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great. i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them. they are really amazing. i love cheddar too, but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor. i recommend them. This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had.  Look at the ingredients:  Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper.  How can you go wrong?Obviously, not for you if you dont like spicy food. But, if you DO like spicy food, youll probably love these.  They have that hot-with-a-hint-of-sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food. I dont write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted.  Every flavor is dynamite.  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon, I would recommend cheddar beer, absolutely amazing.  And theyre healthy!  (besides a lil fat)  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake.  Enjoy, and dont eat them too fast. I bought these for the office and no one can put them down. Im ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks. Didnt have to shop for them either, Amazon brought it to my door! Perfect!! They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt! These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.Enjoy. These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many.  They have the best potato flavor.  They came when you said they would. Great chips, great price.  Odds are that you will have them to yourself.  If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar, you will love these.  The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had (and I love this flavor, mind you).  They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own.  Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind.  -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels.  It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again.  Mmmmm... vinegar... Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone Ive let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. Ive yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed! TOTALLY ORGASMIC.  these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted.  signed up for the subscribe and save option.  the case contained 15(FIFTEEN, FULL SIZED BAGS) OF CHIPS.  the price per unit equals $1.73  per package.  that is not even the cost of plain chips.  if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery, this deal is a steal.  so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the SPICY THAI CHIPS.  p.s.  even if you paid the going price of $30.00, you are still ahead of the curve.  ENJOY Seriously, now. Tasty, tasty, tasty. Fresh, too!The only problem is that you have a pack of 24 and that can lend itself to wanting to make multiple trips to the cupboard for more helpings! Or, grabbing multiple bags to begin with. Pace yourself! I keep saying.You cant go wrong with these if youre a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavor.2-ounce bags are about double the size of the kids bags; about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks. Its really a good size for an adult.Its a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips, but it has 300 calories per bag. Again, not too bad, but something to think about.Bottom-line: Delicious! Despite coming in an extremely large box, I found this to be great value. All the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away. Id definitely recommend. These are the best potato chips that money can buy.  There is just enough salt to taste it, but not so much that it masks the lingering potatoey awesomeness after youve wolfed down a bag of these beauties.  Each chip has the perfect thickness - my teeth get excited every time I put one in my mouth!  Everything about these chips is so perfect, its like they were made by God and delivered by Gabriel himself.  Now that I know Amazon carries these, I dont even have to leave my house to buy them!  I may never eat anything else again! I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joes with my daughter Mindy.  I couldnt believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and Ive been munching them ever since.Other things in their favor: theyre thicker than other chips, so dont crumble as Im devouring them; theyre delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldnt beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isnt that poetic?As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, Im getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that theyre hand-cooked in small batches.I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but theyre also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except \"sweets,\" of course.My only problem is that theyre so delicious I cant stop eating them.  Thats the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isnt easy, but ...Have I told you how much I love them?Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008Millennium Babe: The Prophecy You dont need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so theyre still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if youre on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best. These potato chips are excellent.There are no trans fats.They taste absolutely delicious.Whenever I am in the mood for potatoe chips, Kettles is the brand I buy.A great product that anyone should enjoy and I highly recommend them!Enjoy! It feels strange to review chips, but I am compelled because these are my absolute favorite chips. Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly salted.They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag, plus they often looked burned. They are not actually burned. It has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark. I love to open a bag and find some browned chips.Lays and Wise have their place but Ive become a chip snob thanks to Kettle.Like Edys or Breyers ice cream, some products are worth the money. These are the best of the best. I have tried a lot of S&V chips and these are the best!  Real sea salt and REAL vinegar!  Mouth-watering flavor & crispiness.  Not for the faint of heart - the flavor is very authentic!  :) Kettle brand chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the \"soft\" end of the \"soft/crunchy\" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, youll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy! Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I didnt put them out because the buffet was full and didnt think anyone would like saltless potato chips.  Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out.  OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD!  I was so wrong to think they would be bland; they are full of real potato flavor, wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting.  I am here on amazon to buy a case, I only want to have these with dips.  Truly delicious! These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code.  It was nice to have a larger size bag.  Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch!  They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been.  Great flavor and All Natural! I have tried Herrs, UTZ, wise, pringles, lays etc....but Kettle tasted the best. The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required.Although they say serving size 1 ounce, you will finish the whole packet in no time. Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag. This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon. Chilling in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more; and using them, rather than corn chips, to make nachos will have your tastebuds singing like Janet Jackson. (But without any of the associated wardrobe risks. (-:) HIGHLY recommended. I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the \"One Star\" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in its deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as were all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that thesedifferent flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:PotatoesVegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),Rice PowderSugarSaltOnion PowderTomato PowderPaprikaTorula YeastGarlic PowderChili PepperCitric AcidCayenne PepperPaprika Oleoresin, (Colour)Natural Smoke FlavourNaturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer productionAs far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, thiscan be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as Id like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), Ive taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didnt like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!Flavoured potato PERFECTION! I have loved Kettle Brand Sea Salt and Vinegar chips since the first time i tried them.  The fact that i was able to find them on-line for such a great price, was wonderful.  I would definitely make the purchase again.  THey are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich. Kettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented.  I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice, a veritable cornucopia of flavor.  I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai & Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors, alternating days. I have already lost 5 lbs, not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing. Get your life back - with Kettle Chips. My daughter that has autism craves hot, spice and pungent foods.  These are her absolute favorite chips!  She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time.  I love the crispy kettle way theyre cooked. I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food.  I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in. After reading some of the reviews, I got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst! No worries here. All bags are in great shape and expiration dates arent until June. Chips, at least from the first bag, taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world! By the way, fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so, yay team! I am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact. These chips taste awesome. And unlike most other flavored chips, they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip. Just dont pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption. Theyll totally know it was you. With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I cant recommend these chips enough.  You wont regret it.Some people say they are burnt but they arent.  From their website: \"Take a quick look and youll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: \"At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.\"  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  Im also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period. These are among the best chips I have ever eaten!  I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007.  I wasnt a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read \"Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!\"You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you wont be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so theyre perfect for spring and this coming summers outdoor activities and cook-outs!Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!  Buy some today, and fall in love like me! I have never been addicted to anything in my life...until I tasted these chips.  I have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same.  Youve got to stick with this blue bag of chips! Im addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.As an Oregonian, Im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips.

Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\" I bought these when on sale through Amazon.  Nice crispy thick chips.  Definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale. Ive found a new taste treat. Im not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure Ive come late to discover these. I think they are really good.  The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ !  They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips weve all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before.

Thank you Lord, for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted, and tastes great. I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this. The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. Its slightly hard/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you. These are my favorite, but they arent for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they arent for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag. Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think Ive tried every brand out there.  These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.

I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didnt eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  Ill buy these again...soon. This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags.

On a side note, this brand (Kettle Brand) has many delicious varieties- this is just my personal favorite.  I also highly recommend: Backyard BBQ, Honey Dijon, Sweet Onion, Buffalo Bleu, Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle.  Lays aint got nothin on Kettle Brand!!! Ive eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and theyve always been terrible.  I didnt expect much when I bought these.  But after I tasted them I was amazed.

Not with these, the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until youve finished the bag. These are very addictive. If you like salt and vinegar, these are the ultimate chips. Nothing else compares. Tasted good. Spicy. Those that dont like spicy should stay away from this. For the price paid, very good buy.

This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldnt remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip affection-ados.Sincerely,  § homiedog § I knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips.

This is a delicious tea!Im just now becoming a tea geek and really exploring the stuff I like, and Earl Grey is amongst the top, especially with bergamot.The problem I find is the amount of bergamot added is usually too little, or too much.This one is perfect! I really like the balance in the flavor. I dont add anything to this tea, just a part of a teaspoon in a cup and in 2-3 minutes its ready.Tastes like an expensive tea but priced like Lipton. Definitely recommend it for fans of Earl Grey with a kick! I bought this tea as an alternative to very pricey Teavana Black Teas. I have a cup every morning, very smooth refreshing tea. The tea tin is guarding the aroma very well.The taste is beautiful: the Malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just right.The first time I used too much tea and soaked it for too long (I used as reference Darjeeling FTGFOP First Flush).Since then I save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutes.A delight: the best Earl Grey I ever had. The price is very competitive. Pros:- Extremely fragrant- Full bodied- Can be steeped twice- Nice air-tight container- OrganicCons:- PriceThe Tao of Tea, Blue Flower Earl Grey Black Tea is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted, and I would recommend it to anyone.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPFGO\">The Tao of Tea, Blue Flower Earl Grey Black Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> After a lifetime of tea drinking, I can honestly say that this is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted.  I have ordered it a number of times, and each batch is consistently excellent. I have even given it as a gift, as its container is superb for keeping loose tea fresh.  The metal canister has an inner lid that is lifted with its own attached knob, so the tea stays dry and fresh for the length of time it takes to use it up.  Do yourself a favor, if you like Earl Grey, and treat yourself to this tea. These biscuits are delicious, not too sweet, with just enough crunch.  We love them.  Quick delivery. We would order them again.  Very satisfied. Excellent, lo-fat, lo- calorie treat for dogs. I have a German Shorthair Pointer-and these treats are her favorite( the organic peanut butter cookies are for smaller dogs, but she loves them-and for weight-control I like them!) My male Maltese dog had been enjoying the Old Roys Puppy Biscuits from Walmart.  Then I couldnt find them.  I was desperate to find a treat that would measure up.  I ordered six bags of the peanut butter and crossed my fingers.They arrived, and my little guy loves them.  He gets one heart-shaped biscuit at bedtime.  He sleeps in a crate.  When he hears me touch the bag of treats, he beats a path to his crate in high excitement.  They are a BIG hit with my him.  They are well worth the price.  They are high quality and I can even smell peanuts in them. This product does a great job of clearing out the kidneys.  It has helped make my husband feel lots better even though he is in early renal failure. Love this with a bag of shrimp 3/4 pound, some stir fry veges and a little onion chopped. Not too hot but very tasty. We make up a coffee creamer with 1/4 part commercial coffee creamer, vanilla, butter creme, almond and Bavarian Creme flavors and the rest milk.  It tastes wonderful and is half the price of store-bought!It is excellent! Im from Detroit, and I was raised on Vernors ginger ale.  Once I moved to California, though, I found it difficult to find Vernors.  It would pop up here and there, and then disappear.  I guess without advertising, it just never found a home.I prefer the plastic bottles, but the ideal size is the 16.9 oz (500 ml) or the one liter.  The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person (me) too long to drink it, letting it go flat.In any case, Vernors is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years, I think.  That imparts a great, unique flavor.I wish it would catch on again, and become available more widely.(Recently I did see it on sale in Redwood City in Californias Bay Area, south of San Francisco.  The next day, it was gone! I like \"Vernors\", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernors is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.Vernors is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you cant find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernors Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is \"The Vernors Story: From Gnomes to Now\" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the companys marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernors fans. If you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup, barley malt, or brown rice syrup, this will do nicely. I use Madhavas agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time Im writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.Other than baking, Ive used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just dont use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you wont be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.If you are looking for less caramel flavor, youll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications). First time Ive ever used Agave Nectar -- and it is great.  Keeps the blood sugar stable.  Great buy also! This sweetner is the best, it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to. And it has great health benefts. I love this stuff.  It sweetens without affecting the blood glucose levels.  Now if I could only figure out how to make tequila I would be set.  Just kidding. I finally have found a natural sugar substitute that has the added benefit of having a low glycemic index. Agave is delicious! I have recommended it to many friends, and it is very economical to purchase the 46oz bottles. I love using this to sweeten tea, coffee, etc. It tastes much better than other low glycemic sweeteners - there is no bitter aftertaste. I ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product.  It works great for cooking, baking and as a substitute sugar in my Chai lattes. I really like this product and taste great with the coffee or tea, and I have lost weight by cutting the sugar and replacing it with the honey and Agave nectar. I am so glad I was introduced the this brand of sweetner to replace sugar, this is so much better. I really like how it sweetens my herbal sweet teas without having to use too much, and how it can be used in place of pancake syrup too. Learning how to use it what the first thing I had to learn, once I learned how to use it, I became hooked. I would not even look at sugar any more. I highly reccomend if you want a clean fresh taste and feel to your foods.If you do purchase this sweetner, take advantage of ship and save, it will save you lots of money in the long run. I love this product! It is the best natural sweetener I have ever tried, and I have tried many. You can use also as pancake syrup or as a substitute for honey on your peanut butter and honey sandwich. It last a long time, and is a good value. I have been using Agave Nectar for several months now and have found it to be a staple in my home. Madhava Agave Nectar is good tasting, it was a good buy! This stuff is great because its low glycemic. Substitute this to sugar and youll be doing your body a great favor.  This size is economical and shipping is fast, too.  I got mine very soon. Save a little money buying in larger quantities, as opposed to the smaller bottles. I like the taste of Agave, cross between honey/maple. Good for pies, cereal, frozen yogurt, etc. This is an awesome product which Ive ordered many times.  Honey-like flavored, lower glycemic sweetener thats great in coffee or tea. thank you for this product - we use it all the time and appreciate your promptness and the price was excellent.  Thanks again. I am on a low glycemic index diet to help control my blood sugar and hormone levels. My nutritionist recommended agave nectar as a sweetener since its GI index is in the low 30s as opposed to honey in the low 50s and sugar in the mid-50s. Ive tried supermarkets, health food stores and wholesale clubs. The prices are usually around $13 for a 32oz bottle and this is $19ish for 2x46oz. Its used like honey - substitute 2/3c for every 1c sugar and reduce liquids by 1/4th.I also use it in a carrot cake recipe (equal substitution) instead of sugar where I substitute whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I dont decrease the other liquids. Its delicious and youd never know thats its actually good for you. I was out to dinner with friends & family at \"The Saloon\" in \"Rte 46 Entertainment Complex\" in Sanford FL. Besides having an awesome staff (ask for Keith) and fabulous food (the escargot is a MUST) they serve China Mist tea. This is the 1st time I chose the Tropical Organic Green -- I have no doubt it is the best flavored tea I have ever had. If youve tried the conventional Kettle crinkle chip verson Salt and Peper, you CANT compare these to those!  These are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat, but oompletely enjoyable.  You finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices.  Great stuff. These are the best tasting tortilla chips I have ever had!  I have become allergic to tomatoes, but I love tortilla chips.  There is so much flavor in these chips that I no longer miss pico de gallo. I prefer to eat them plain. They also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful, but not overpoweringly spicy. These potato chips are DELICIOUS!  I have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips.  Amazon lowered the price on these, and I finally had a chance to order them.  I most definitely will be ordering them again!  My family and I love them.  They are pure and void of all artificial flavorings.  The true flavor is present, and it satisifies the need for something salty, sweet, spicy, and crunchy.  A++++ thesedont like hot food they might be a bit much for you. They have a great balance of sweetness and spice. Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I dont want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips. Just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet! Very hard to find in New Jersey. Can not have just one bag around!! I cant believe how wonderful this chip is! The slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor. My family and I are offically addicted. These are the best chips I have ever eaten. Everyone in our family loves them. Sweet but spicy- crispy....really good. Delivery was perfect, no crushed chips. Fantastic overall. A nice case of chips that are quite tasty. I definitely enjoy the Kettle Sea Salt and Black Pepper. I just wish they were bigger bags :) I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.I also like that its organic.I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if theyre not sinfully delicious.Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. Thats about par for the course for fried chips.Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.Enjoy.Mir At first you think that these chips arent all that Spicy, but the spice will grow on you with each bite.  They are really very good! I cant say enough good things about Plockys chips!!  I have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWKO7G\">Plockys Tortilla Chips, Black Beans N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and I love them!  They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying.  I have never eaten a tortilla chip that didnt make me feel guilty afterwards.  Not with Plockys...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plockys chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon. My aunt gave me a bag of these and I was immediately addicted. There are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips. I love the zip, agreed they are awesome without salsa, and no trans fat! We love these chips. They can be eaten alone, since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip. Every one that we have introduced the chips to, loves them. And the expiration date is for 8 months from now, so ordering 12 bags didnt come near to them going stale. I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera. I Love these chips for its unique taste and incredible crispy texture. Used to get them at Henrys in San Diego, CA before we moved out of there and have been ordering them from Amazon since. Running out of them constantly! We love these. Cant always get them in local stores, they dont keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out. Strong enough to dip in any condiment, great flavor and grain texture. The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007.  I couldnt find them in our area (CT) so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon.  I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!  Only problem is, now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in, but thats ok...sharing is good. These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you cant go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag Ive come across. The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags. I used to buy these at the local supermarket, but they are no longer carried there.  Finding them on Amazon I purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as I remembered.  For chips they are also very healthy.  I definately will buy them again. Plockys Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips are really tasty. I shared a few bags with my daughter in Iraq. She said Ummm they are Good. They are good for you too. No artificial stuff. We like PlockysThey like us.Plockys Plockys.Mean no fuss.Taste so good.And healthy too.Plockys Plockys.Grab a bag or two.Thank you Plockys!! I Love these potato chip they r soooo good! =) sweet and spicy but not overwhelming just enough to work up the palate, not salty just enough to balance out the sweetness I will be ordering these again soon. LOVe IT! The best potato chips Ive ever had at the best price Ive ever paid. The service was respectable and the shipping free. I love this product.  All of the different flavors are fantastic.  My family likes the 3 grain the best.  No more corn tortilla chips in this house! Love these chips, and I dont even like black beans.  Very tasty.  Yum!!  Plus, good for you! These chips are FANFREAKINTASTIC. They are with out a doubt the best chips that I have ever had. A nice sweet smoky flavor and then a little bit-o-heat. OH YA BABY. Nice amount of heat and smoke. Very tasty chip that goes great with a brew. These chips are salty with a hint of sweet. They are crisp and crunchy. They are the best chips Ive ever had! We ordered these only because the Black Beans and Rice,which we really. really love, was out of stock.  After about a week, we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier.  There is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort.  We took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag.  I used them, from another bag, as a garnish on a salad that I took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowl!We will definitely order these again.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLUGU\">Plockys Tortilla Chips, Red Beans N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> I was first introduced to the Red Rice & Beans chips in my hometown of Bethlehem, PA.  When I moved to North Carolina I was unable to find these chips in my local area.  On my trips back home, I would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to NC.  Then I discovered that I could order them on-line and life was great.  These chips are my all time favorite and everyone that I serve them to loves them just the same.  You just gotta try them ... youll be hooked !!!  ..... Nancy Walsh Ok. If you dont want to get addicted, dont try Plockys Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips! My husband and I started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store. Now, weve just received our second case. It wont last long. Beware. My husband (who, being Mexican, is very picky about his tortilla chips) and I absolutely love these!  The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that were both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although theyre particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these! <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLUGU\">Plockys Tortilla Chips, Red Beans N Rice, 7 Ounce Bag (Pack of 12)</a>  I first tasted these chips while visiting relatives in KY.  They are not available where I live, so I ordered them from Amazon.  WOW!  My friends and family are all addicted to them.  The spicy flavor grabs you at the first bite.  Once a bag is open, it is gone! We like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market. They are even great by themselves. We will order these as long as they are available. Thank you for making them accessable.  Shelly Kenyon Plockys chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness.  They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery, but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty.  Order by the case.  Youll be glad you did as they disappear fast. I received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them. I searched high and low, but was unable to find them until I saw them here. I immediately ordered a case. These chips are light, crispy, flavorful, and good for you. I love them with dip, in chili, or just plain. Once you try them, youll be hooked! These chips are truly amazing. They have it all. Theyre light, crisp, great tasting, nice texture, AND theyre all natural... AND low in fat and sodium! Need I say more? I recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store, and couldnt belive my taste buds. Thats why I excited why I saw them here on Amazon, and decided to buy a case! These are the most fantastic chips Ive ever had!  I could eat the whole bag myself!  Theyre made with lots of whole grain and beans, and make a complete protein, so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks.  They are great!  The only problem I have with them:  The bag is too small!!!  We need a bigger bag!! :) They did a very good job with shipping the order quickly....Nothing like Ace Hardware who took a week to ship Wonderful candy, hard to find.  I got a huge bag and put it in freezer.  It came shipped nicely in a sturdy box and heavy plastic. Just great! So surprised to find the Taiwan-shaped pineapple cakes, they are so cute!Ive never found any pineapple cake like this at our local Asian supermarkets, so I ordered some from here. These lovely pastries made our Dragon Boat Festival party much more fun. My friends and I think it is a good idea to  order them again for our Mid-Autumn Festival party. I purchased this 24 pack of Big Ass soda and only got 23. Immediately I was all like \"Oh man, this is gonna suck!\". Regardless of the quantity error though, it sure kicked some red.Everyone in my town absolutely loves it. I highly recommend along with other soda, Voltages.-Malcom Well being the big red fan that I am, I bought some of this. First of all let me tell you the price is amazing, I mean where else can you get this type of deal in Saudi Arabia. Everyone in village loved it, of course now they are wondering when the next shipment will get it. This cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor.  Its moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that isnt terribly bad for your diet.  Its delicious! I work in college Financial Aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students.  I used to buy them in the grocery store then learned I could get them for less online ($17 for 3lb bag) and thought that was a good deal - until I found this GREAT deal! This is pretty good canned meat. The sausage I used in dirty rice, the hamburger I used for taco salad, the chicken with wild rice, and the pork with stuffing. the turkey I gave to a neighbor because I dont eat it. The various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for 3 large portions each can. There werent large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans, which Ive experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats. The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, its not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned, at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. There is a mild \"spam\"-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, thats why I heavily seasoned it. Dont plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats, it gave everything a slightly rancid, soury taste...no idea why! Due to the higher calories and higher price, I will only stock this as emergency food. I will buy more for that reason.

With all thats in it, this is a very good value. Considering you can pay as much for any one of the ingredients in it. My personal use is to add this to kombucha, maximizing its longevity that way, Ive tried many but this one is the best for kombucha. They say an 8oz glass has 2 servings of fruit on the Lakewood website. Its quite tasty in that its not too sweet, very thick textured even with the tiny bits of seed in it reminiscent of a banana smoothie. The ingredient list is somewhat confusing but note that only the Acerola Cherry is from concentrate, everything else is fresh pressed. Acai is very high on the ORAC scale of anti-oxidants, Rose Hips are also very high, everything else is in the mid to high range of fruit. Pomegranate has many beneficial properties beyond just anti-oxidants as well, its a noteworthy fighter of heart disease and Alzheimers type dementia. Considering the price of Goji berries I really like their inclusion in this drink, albeit at a lesser level.BTW: Amazon had only 1 day wait before shipping. If this flavor lasted longer than it does, Id probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth. this gum is super sick.tatooes are killin.flavor is a spankin.this brings back bomb diggity memories yo.peace out. I watched an episode o \"How Things are Made\" on Discovery Channell and saw Bluegrass Soy Sauce featured.  On a whim, I ordered a bottle.  It took several weeks to arrive, but when it did - what a surprise.  My teenage son wanted to try it, and did.  He loved it immediately.  Now he puts it on many things. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised and liked it very much.  In the past, I made many trips to the Far East and developed a real liking for Soy Sauce (where virtually all of it is made).  What a treat to find a handmade American product, that competes with (and wins), against a Japanese/Chinese national staple! My bottle arrived just in time for a sushi dinner and game night planned with friends.  I had three soy sauces to choose from.  After some sampling we were all using the Bluegrass!  Everyone enjoyed the light smoothness a subtle sweetness.  We were splashing right on every piece, rather that dunking/dipping. Friends wanted to know where I found it. Im going back to order more right now, and Ill be ordering 3 extra bottles because they are going to make a great little gift thats affordable and unique; instead of the traditional bottle of wine that so common its boring. If you enjoy the flavor of soy you will really like this.Plus its hand made in the good ole USA. I recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed.  It has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket brands.  Ive used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra.  Quite a surprise to find an American made soy sauce that tastes this good! This soy sauce is the best we have ever had.  Thanks to Amazon, we were able to find it again.  It makes a big difference when using this product.  Thanks again This is the most delicious soy sauce I have ever tasted.  I will surely order it again.  Such deep flavor. Saw this on How it is made, which was a very interesting process.Decided to give it a try, I really enjoy the flavor it adds.Looking forward to trying it on several more dishes.Thanks to those who brewed it! Im pleased with these- wasnt sure how theyd be able to replicate the autumn classic flavors of caramel apples, but figured Werthers was a good bet.  Im diabetic, so wolfing down a real caramel apple when the mood strikes just cant happen as often as Id like to do so.  But these are tasty enough to get me through until I can carb budget  the real thing. These are made with sugar alcohols, so its wise to limit how many are eaten in a day unless youre going to be near home and have turbo-flush on your toilet.  (TMI???)  This pack of 6 will last a while, but theyre definitely a will reorder.  :) This is a bold blend that has a great taste. The flavor comes bursting through. I usually brew & drink Organic Sumatra Mandeling from BJs. I use this blend exclusively, so to get a cup that rivals the complex flavor from my Tassimo brewer is fantastic. Come on Amazon add it to the subscription service. Weve tried many Tassimo flavors.  This is by far our favorite.  Our normal cup of coffee is Starbucks house blend out of a Cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our Tassimo.  This coffee is rich but not too stong.  I dont understand the current price over $20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on Amazon.  For now, well buy elsewhere. This is one of the best choices, in my opinion.  I also adore Amazon, but they need to negotiate a better price for their Tassimo Disks.  These are available at BedBath & Beyond for $10. and I always get 20% off which brings it down to $8.00 --- they were $7.50 (before the 20% off readily available coupons) until about 3 months ago.  Again, this is an excellent blend with full flavor - not bitter - I think its my favorite. Of all the coffees available for Tassimo this Kona has the richest flavor and fantastic aroma byfar my favorite. I think these are my favorite cookies ever. Really light and creamy. Too bad you can no longer find them anywhere for less than two-hundred count! I dont think I need THAT many. I ordered for my dad for fathers day and he ate the whole box within two days.He said it tasted really good, now I want to order some for myself, haha. I eat mustard with everything, this is hands down THE BESt mustard I have ever tried, in fact everyone I tell to try some, falls in love with it as well. Spicy, tasty, real quality.If you like spicy mustard, you will love this. This product works wonders if you have stomach issues.  I would buy again once I need more. :0) Our ferret loves this rabbit; its a nice high protein treat in addition to his regular Evo ferret diet. The price was reasonable compared to our local pet store, which doesnt often have this item in stock. My son made this.  He didnt have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when, half an hour before it was done, it appeared not to have risen at all--I feared for the worse.  Determined to be polite, I agreed to have a sandwich using the bread.  It was amazing.  Apparently it rises during the baking or something.Great tangy flavor (perfect for a meat sandwich imho) and not heavy at all.  Fortunately we had lots of deli meats, since the whole loaf disappeared within the hour.Weve had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far; Im sure that will be delicious as well. These were great - just as described. Used them for a bee-themed party, and now we use them as \"to go\" packs of honey for our coffee and tea. I was pleasantly surprised to find this item had been delivered the day after my order, my speediest delivery to date. It probably helps my location is near. Everything looks just as described and pictured and Im very happy to have done business with this seller. The Gingerbread house was carefully packaged as not to harm the fragile pieces inside. Im excited to give this item as a gift. I love the aroma and the taste of the fruit and vanilla combo, and the addition of ginseng for an added energy boost rounds this tea out nicely for me. Its a sweet tea, which makes it a wonderful healthy alternative to desert after dinner.I see that others didnt like it, but its really a matter of personal taste...different courses for different horses! The best chocolate in the world, in this critics humble opinion, is made in the United States. And the best chocolate in the United States is made in California, by the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. It is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores, malls, etc. throughout the United States. Their actual stores are rare, but Kroger, Wal-Mart, Martins (formerly Ukrops) and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their products.I have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these. These are chocolates deserving of poetry. You can eat them quickly, or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one. The choice is up to you. This is a good quality brand of chocolate with many flavours of which this is just one. Very tasty and a fast delivery too My mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven.  They didnt believe they deserved receiving these, but I know they did deserve to receive these! This is the best caramel/chocolate combination I have ever tasted. The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.  The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.  At the very least try the Ghiradelli. This chocolate treat is a great gift and it arrived right when I expected it to. I gave it to my girlfriend as a surprise gift and she absolutely loved it. the first time i ordered this it came all melted but amazon was quick to remedy the situation by sending me another of the product and it was great thank you Low calorie and satisfying. These soups are a nice fill in when you dont want too much but dont want to be hungry for a few hours. Purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal.  She was very happy and loved the basket.  She enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included.  Shipped quick and arrived when expected. Received very quickly and extremely well packaged.  Since this is a smaller sized basket, it would be an adorable present for anyone who likes tea, for self or just to have to hand.  Very nicely assembled with attention to detail. These small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that I have never been able to find in the past when I wanted them.  Amazon now provides a link.  They can be used for what are commonly called \"jello shots,\" and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups. I bought these chocolate liquor cups for a party! It was a big hit. They are high quality and a good buy. Great for serving Chocolate liquor. Adds a touch of class to your event and elevates you to host supreme. Being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake. Delicious chocolate cups, each in its own aluminum holder.  I could not find these in any local store, so was happy to find them on-line.Most people are unaware of them, so they are impressed when I serve them a little cordial or other liquor in a chocolate cup.  After sipping theliquor, you can eat the cup.  What could be nicer?  Excellent product. The holiday liquor cups were exactly what I was looking for.  The chocolate isdelicious and holds up well to the liquors I love this flavor and I cant find it on the shelves anymore. The gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when I used to buy it in stores! If some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he doesnt like the taste, I feel I must assert that in this -as in all matters of taste- \"De Gustibus Non Disputandem Est\".I really love this gum. OK it doesnt really taste like strawberry, but its still delicious. It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through, but then it gets tired, stuff, and squeaky.Youll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find, as I did, that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid. By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25# in 3 months.Also, it doesnt lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight. BEST DOG FOOD ON THE MARKET TODAY.  HAD NUMEROUS EAR PROBLEMS WITH OUR COCKER SPANIEL AND THEY HAVE CLEARED UP SINCE TAKING THIS FOOD. My father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old Cocker Spaniel, so I decided to take her into my family. When I brought her to NYC she had ear and eye discharge. She was also  slightly overweight. After a check up with a vet that ruled out infection, I decided to try Royal Canin based on the numerous good reviews.Within a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight. This is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her! Our Spaniel has tried several foods in her 6 years, and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any \"people food\" being added (of course, we still treat her occasionally).  When we went in for our 12 month tooth-cleaning appointment, the vet told us to take her home as her teeth didnt need any cleaning for another 6 months, at least.  It is specially designed for their teeth and health needs, and she loves it.  And it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store!  What more could you ask? Royal Canin was recommended for my dog, but since this line of dog food is specific to breed, it was difficult to find in stores.  PetsMart and Petco carried the Cocker Spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio.  Finding a larger bag has been a great deal.  My cocker loves the food too! This is food especially designed for Cocker spaniels who have a range of health issues...I have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it. It also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time. Great product! I tired many different dog foods over the 3 yrs I have my cocker spaniel. I then came upon this breed specific dog food & figured Id try it. My dog loves this food and always finishes his food. Ive used this for over 1 yr now & he has not tired of it. I have seen a significant change (for the better) in him, hes more active and doing well.I only buy this brand food for him now.Buster gives it 2 paws up & I give it 5 stars. fast and great service, my Cavashon Loves this low fat dog food. Thanks. Arrived in great condition, thank you thank you thank you We are Chocolate Moose & Mickey Moose,Our nice owner bought this great food for us.  We love it very much, I have gained 5 lbs. because I eat all of Mickeys food when he isnt looking!  Our skin and fur is much better now too.  :) My 7 year old Cocker Spaniel loves this food and its good for him -- he needs to lose a few pounds and this is doing the trick.  Glad I found it on Amazon.  Hard to find elsewhere. My 50lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much, but as time went on I found more and more uses for it. I have so many recipes that I make weekly that Im running out! This is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything Ive found in the grocery store. Better than organic oats advertised elsewhere. Takes lots of water. These are not minute oats, so my oatmeal cookies come out right, not all crumbly and soggy. (Instant oats have their place, but not in cookies). Honeyville Rolled Oats is a delicious product.  I am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothers.The oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is I only paid $4.99 shipping for 50lbs of oats!  I encourage anyone who likes oats to order Honeyville Rolled Oats.  Their flavor is above all the rest. Nice flavor, not too bitter.  We really like this coffee.  We have been searching for a coffee that pleases the whole familys tastes and this is the one. My first taste of this tea saved my trip home from Santa Cruz, when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags.  How I needed my fix!  A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned, and this Chinese Breakfast / Yunnan Black Tea set me straight.Other reviewers have said it tastes odd.  The flavor is strong and a bit smoky, like Darjeeling, only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey, it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But its expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly, well-sealed, and true to the label -- unlike some \"loose\" tea thats actually cut up, this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh. This tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this tea-drinking household. We love it and it really starts the morning off right. Perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites?? The taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL9X6\">Numi Organic Tea Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea, Loose Leaf, 16 oz bag (Pack of 2)</a>I brew iced tea in the refrigerator by the half-gallon with this tea. Excellent. The resealable bags work well, and unopened they protect my large stash, making it easier to manage my subscription. Ive used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious, consistently good quality black tea. Mainly I use it and several other Numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha. It always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea.  I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it.  Its an excellent morning tea, is smooth without being insipid, and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping. Just use decent water.  I like a little stevia in it, as Im a wimp. It brings out the natural sweetness of its malty, slightly floral style.  I just bought another two pounds. I hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent.  I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers.  It is flavorful without being overpowering.  It is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced.  After the first try I have continued to drink it just as it comes.  You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea. I read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that I did. I have purchased other Numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of theri products. Having eaten (and re-eaten) my way though all of the DAS caramel range, this remains my all-time favorite, and the one that usually gets the most rave reviews when I share them (which isnt an easy thing to do - just try one and youll see what I mean).  Ive been a caramel fan for ages, and while Werthers Butterscotch will do in a pinch, nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these.  They are chewy, buttery, and the little crunches of salt are spectacular (OK my mother didnt put salt in hers, this is an improvement). Although I did enjoy the other flavor I ordered a tiny bit more, the Chocolate with walnuts one, this was still a very enjoyable flavor.  Wonderful service from Ms. Das, including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders, along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors.  Id order this or the Chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure, along with more of Das Foods gourmet salt. This is certainly the best caramels I have ever had.  I just wish it came in bigger pieces.  I finished the whole box in one sitting!  I will certainly buy them again. This baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons.  I take it for acid indigestion and heart burn.  Just a 1 tsp in a half glass of water and its gone.  I use it to make my body more alkaline, so its great for changing your pH level in your body! I recently started using Bobs Red Mill Baking Soda.  Im very pleased with its performance and I can be sure that it is not contaminated with aluminum.  Thanks, Bob! The product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.Delivery was unexpectedly fast.The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack. While this may be commonplace, a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight, food grade, plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag.  Could be either a zip-lock bag or a twist tie closure... doesnt make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.This is a health and spoilage issue... 50#s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers (very expensive and hard to find}. I am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security.  Long term storage is a big issue with people like me.Thom (Missouri) Im happy with the quality of the product and the price. Like the other reviewer, I would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness. However, I will continue to buy this product regardless as it is quality oatmeal at a good price.Edit: Im on my 4th bag, quality continues to be high. Product is fresh, good and Im not getting complaints anymore.Thats worth the large quantity and shipping charges.Hey, its oatmeal. My favorite! Good quality oats. Package came on time. Oats worked well in recipes. I will admit, as a single person I bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food- it lasted us for the year.Otherwise its an excellent buy. Of the many purchses I made on Amazon this past December, I was most pleased with the Pocky Chocolate Cream Covered Biscuit Sticks (Pack of 10). They arrived on time, and they were a hit as a surprised gift. Be sure to keep them refridgerated. Got these for my kids as Christmas stocking stuffers.  They love them.  As far as delivery, the product came in good condition, timely, and was terrific.  Definitely a good buy. Im not sure how you review something thats as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, youll like this (it doesnt taste exactly like either of those, but thats the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you dont get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.Heres some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then youll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility theyre manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesnt use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if youre particularly sensitive to either.Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so thats quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, dont order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!  Duh!  :) First of all, I love the packaging making it heatproof but it wouldnt have been a problem because I ordered it it winter and they were freakishly cold. I also want to thank VeryAsia for the free sample of mi goreng...it was delicious!!! I now love mi goreng. I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldnt say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesnt melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. Im definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I cant find a local storeEDIT: Oct 11, 2012*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****So I decided to restock after I couldnt fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I wont be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I wont change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isnt \"terrible\" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received. Bought these for my daughters Grad party as well as the Strawberry. She loves these things. Theyre a great product. Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though Id heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.This is by no means a health food (its in the same category as a cookie, its got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, its junk food. We all know its supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless youre really prone to binge-eating or cant stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldnt recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. Theyre really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout caramel delights\" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.However, with this crazy hot summer, Id recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until falls cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and theyll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tates Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED). Pocky is an incredibly good snack, but more than that, I was impressed with Very Asias packaging. I had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer. On top of that the package of dessert pocky I ordered in 100 degree weather melted into this liquid goo. T_T So of course I was expecting all the pocky in my 10 boxes to be melted away, but they took the special care to put the pocky in a box reading \"PROTECT FROM HEAT\" and my pocky arriving in perfect condition! (Well, they did stick together just a bit). I love Very Asia more than anything now. Everyone loves Pocky and if they say they dont they are lying lol. The Pocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces. These where great couldnt stop eating them.Lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next time.Cant say enough about these, they where shipped faster than what I paid to have shipped also.Thank you so much. I had bought Pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no Asian stores I have to shop on the internet. The guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason. For a bit of insanity, search for Pocky commercials on youtube! This was the first peanut free product I bought for my son.  I thought they were tasty.  The kids liked them too.  For some reason they think they are strawberry bars.  I love the soft texture and the non crumbly state.  It makes for clean car rides.  Since then they like the apple and chocolate bars the best.  Berry is always left for last.  Amazon has a wonderful price and I just wish it could be a subscribe item. My son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars.  I find that they have a good berry taste.  They also have a nice chewyness. My son has severe allergies.  This is an item he loves and is a convenience for me.  I feel good giving them to him and they taste great! If you are looking for a great gluten free snack you wont be sorry you chose this product. My favorite flavor is the apple and nut. Great taste. Great ingredients. Great texture. Absolutely delicious! They are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal. I give one to my 5 year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more. Either that or they taste so good he wants more. Recently diagnosed a gluten-intolerant, I have been looking for products that allow me to resume a semblance of my former life. These snack bars fit the bill. They have the mouth-feel of a traditional snack bar, and a pleasant tart-sweet fruit flavor. If you want a really good snack bar try these, they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar, but without the gluten!! I buy these regularly. My brother bought me a pound of this coffee for Christmas.  He told me that \"weaver\" was the original roaster for Petes coffee, he eventually split off and started his own roaster.  Well let me tell you the stuff is delicious!  Ive never been married to a brand of coffee, usually would buy the Starbucks 2.5 lb bag at Costco, or whatever looked good at Trader Joes, but Weavers is in a class of its own.  Im subscribing to guarantee I can have this stuff delivered to me regularly.  TRY IT!! This is the best coffee weve ever had. A light taste but very full bodied. I was very pleased with the packaging, having it resealable keeps it stay fresher much longer and unlike other brands this construction stays intact. I must say you wont be displeased with your purchase, this is a must buy! This is the best coffee weve ever had.  I run The American Pavilion in Cannes and Weavers was by far and  away our most popular coffee sponsor!  Hundreds of people come to The Pavilion every day looking for American coffee and they were not disappointed.  We did a booming business this year!  Buy it!  Youll be so happy you did!  Julie The product is all that it says it is which is why I gave it 5 stars.  However, I do have issues with the product, namely, me and my family members cant take the smell.  The taste is horrible so I put it in a lotion cream and rubbed it on my skin.  This was a few weeks ago and though Ive since changed my sheets, the scent is still in my bed.  Ultimately, I stopped using it because it made me smell in a way I did not like.  It smells like an Indian spice and while it didnt work for me, scent-wise, it may work fine with someone else. My little girl cant get enough of this! I like that it is organic and contains fruit, veggies, protein and grains in one tasty meal. I wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars. Its my daughters favorite first and foremost.  For me I love that i can get lentils, there arent many stage 2 or 3 vegetarian choices. This is my sons favorite dinner! Best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein (21%) , vitamin A (100%) and C (30%). It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it. Love love love this brand and flavor. I think I purchased 50 jars so far. I dont know how everyone else got these broken, but when I received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap, not a single jar was broken.  My son loves them and the price was great and I had no issues at all. I would love to say that I have the time to make my sons food everyday. Its not the case. Honestly, I do make it most of the time, but some days, you just dont have the time/energy to get it all done. Enter this product. Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you dont have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into babys diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend. Soft smooth texture - my little one devours this one...it is one of the best meat/veg dinners we have found! This is the only food my daughter will eat consistly. She really enjoys it. The packaging is great. Never had any broken (having ordered 4 times). My son loves the rice and lentil jars.  Its not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars.  I have it on order with subscribe and save + amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged. I have twin girls, they both loved the Vegetable Turkey Dinner.  It was one of their favorite baby foods.  Great price. My son really enjoys Earths Best lentil!  He eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more.  The product shipped very quickly. I love the fact that there is turkey being offered. This is my sons 2nd favorite dish. No issues with it and a good balance of nutrients. This is one of my sons favorite baby foods.  It does have a bit of sweetness, but not too sweet.  Its more runny than some of the other flavors, so we use a deeper spoon with this one, or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up. The Rice and Lentil dinner is our sons absolute favorite. I dont know why but he gobbles this up every time. He enjoys most of the Earths Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesnt eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination. Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar. I always try the food before I feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good. My daughter LOVES it. She gets all excited when I make it for her From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that hed actually finish the whole jar.  I didnt expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.Also, Earths Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesnt really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earths Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too. This tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too -- hes constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these. I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that mustve been fixed b/c Ive not had any problems at all -- in fact, they securely bubble wrap these, then place them in an air-cushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time. I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the jars open easily. Great on the go snack. My son started eating this when he was around 8 months old; hes now 14 months old and its one of his favorites. Unfortunately, they dont carry it at the local grocery store (they carry other varieties of Earths Best; just not this one or his other favorites, Spinach/Potatoes and Spaghetti with Cheese); they do carry it at some of the Whole Foods so I buy them there. Im so glad to find them on Amazon! I get TIRED of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the store.We use this as a base and mix in other things - bits of cooked broccoli, small pieces of meat. Ive also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors. My baby loves Rice and Lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat.  If we are going somewhere I wont be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold. My daughter loved this stuff. It is all natural and made very well.  Good to mix with other things as they get older too!  Beats Gerber. My daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this.  We tried 3rd foods on her and she doesnt like the texture of them.  This is really good for her and she likes it, so we keep buying it. My son loves the Best Earths baby food and his favorite seems to be the Vegetable and Turkey. He smiles at every mouthful.I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way. All the food I feed my son is through Earths Best. My six month old baby loves the Earths Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner - its his favorite. He seems to love all the Earths Best 2nd foods - fruits, vegetables, and dinners. The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat - not too thick, not too thin. The earths best he eats the most, this one is a little thicker than his original chicken/sweet potato favorite which is very runny. Id continue to buy but Im moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too. I am a true Seattle coffee addict, and I have never had a better coffee candy. This fruit gift really was the perfect gift! Everything was fresh, well packed and tasty looking! And the people that received it assured me that it was quite tasty tasting too. And tried the chocolate covered cherries ad was surprised at how delicious they were! So thank you! I needed something in a pinch and it came even earlier than expected!SO THANK YOU AGAIN! Dharana,San Francisco I got it for my Girlfriend for her Birthday.  The Fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy!  I love dark chocolate, so I loved the dark chocolate almonds.  Next time Ill give the Organic version of this product... to someone close so they share with me  :) As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad. I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great. I purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present, she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time, I didnt realize it was so hard to find!  She absolutely loves it, made a great surprise christmas gift. I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  Im actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Dont trust the FDA!! bought this for my dad. for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he hasnt had this tea since he was about 9. finally, after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed, i bought him the tea so hed shut up. Great tasting tea I have been looking for a good  Sassafras tea forever.Finally. I will be ordering this product again .Thanks Kim:D I love Panang Curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it.  So decided to try making my own, and with this product, I get exactly what I want, hot tasty Panang Curry adding lots of fresh veggies, tofu and brown rice.  And its very hot, didnt have to add any spices at all.  Great product, will purchase again. Best paste I have tried! So easy to use. Just saute you meat, add veggies, paste, and a tin of coconut milk. Quick and tasty! I am on weight watchers and tried using the light coconut milk instead of the full fat. It works for the panang paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter.. but the yellow, green, and red are spicy and need the full fat coconut milk to balance it out. This gravy mix is excellent ... except, dont use water where called for, use milk instead, and it makes it 100% better!! Im not from the south, but live in SoFla; where sometimes we get a southern influence. The gravy mix I am reviewing, PIONEER COUNTRY GRAVY is DE-LICIOUS!!! Ive tried others Publix brand, Mc Cormick, ect, but this is the BEST! BY FAR! I chose to mix 1/2 water 1/2 milk, + 2 cooked, chopped sausage links, and it was phenomenal on my [...]. BISQUICK CHEESE GARLIC BISQUITS (Like Red Lobsters), served with a small side of watercress scrambled eggs. Its super easy to make and THICK! FINGER LICKIN! MMMmmmm. I heard you can put it on potatoes/veggies and chicken, make soups and add for seasoning. PIONEER BRAND as the name says is A HOMESTYLE, AMERICAN CLASSIC! Nothing easier. Nothing better. Even beats grandmothers white gravy recipe. Already peppered for you. You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint. I have used Pioneer Gravy for a number of years.  It is VERY easy to make and tastes great, also.  Goes very well over mashed potatoes, meats, etc.  Try it! Its great to be able to get sugar this way.Its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body,and i am helping the  fair trade farmers.It is a good thing all around.I am happy i can get it in Amazon. I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar.  I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much, it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try.  Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I dont think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable.  I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about $7.  That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price.  As I started calculating all of the online prices, they are charging about $7 bucks for the 19 count.  I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper.  So you dont have to do the math...$7 / 38 = .184 per single.  Online price $27 / 114 = .236 (shipping not calculated in).  Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier, you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69, no sales tax and free shipping...sounds like a great deal??  12 x 19 = 228 singles so $69 / 228 = .302 per single - the most expensive at all. I keep Regular bags and Decaf bags in my home at all times.Never have to drink old coffee.  Best way to make iced coffee. My primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by Folger. You get more coffee for less money.  I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years. Since I didnt know how many cups a day I would use, I wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker. I dont particularly like instant coffee. I was delighted to find these Folgers bags.  They brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee. Im not any kind of coffee expert, so I dont know what special terms might be used. All I know is that if I let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute, it sure tastes good. Thanks to my very much better half, Ive also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee.  Very convenient, very easy, very tasty. I intend to take some of these with me when I travel as an alternative to the in-room coffee makers or (yeck!) vending machines.Jerry We cant have any kind of coffee maker at work, so were forced to buy at the in-house coffee shop or Starbucks across the street. In this economy, no one wants to pay those high prices, so we started a coffee club. 20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh, hot, tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices. thanks Folgers!!! These are great for at work, just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee. This is the best tasting coffee. Its easy to make without a mess. Fast, easy and definitely delicious.  Makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make.  Good purchase.  Will continue to order from here.Thanx... I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And Im glad I did. It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma. It has a nice reddish color. This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea Ive had, and I look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that Ive read about. I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water, and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well. Well worth every penny. I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matchas products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh, has a consistent texture and tastes great.  Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity.  I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase. This is the very best marinade you can buy as far as I am concerned---of course, everyone to his or her own tastes, but all in all, I think anyone will like it---I give it five stars... This is a great product for those looking for an MSG and Gluten free product, and is also lower sodium than any other marinade or soy sauce out there! It doesnt compromise of taste either, I use it as a Soy Sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should. If you are Celiac or Gluten intolerant, or even just watching you salt intake, this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too! My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try andour family really enjoyed it. I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleasedwith the natural ingredients and no calories. This hot sauce is one of my favorites. Its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy. You can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle. A mix of garlic, habanero, and other spices. I put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce. I was never much of a hot sauce fan until I tasted Black Market Hot Sauce. I was listning to the radio one morning and the creater/owner was giving an interview, It sounded interesting. The D.J.s were sampling the sauce and raving about it, So I picked up a bottle at the local grocery, Its so good ! I keep a bottle in the kitchen and an extra bottle on hand for gifts and for taking to potlucks,barbecues and partys. Happy to see I can buy it online at Amazon. This is my favorite hot sauce! I liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor. I have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great product.I really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos! They have this in a local diner that I eat in regularly.  I use it on all kinds of foods and I love it.  Its hot, but not without flavor.  I dont like those sauces that just burn but have no taste.  This has both burn and and awesome flavor.  I was surprised to find it on Amazon (just stumbled across it).  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce. I was browsing around on Amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here. I will just order and have shipped to my friends. Habanero is my favorite, I love the heat and the tangy spiciness. I also love the pineapple. You will not go wrong ordering this up. This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce! So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing. My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice. absolutely love the habenaro sauce...use it on eggs, sandwiches most anything for a good kick! have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown product...have nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the product..get out there and try it! BLACK MARKET HOT SAUCE IS WONDERFUL.... My husband Loves this Habenero sauce, its very very flavorful with a nice kick to it. I in fact love the medium sauce- the taste is so yummy with a bit of zing behind it. We used it for everything and you can use it with any meal.I like the fact that there are so many different levels of spicyness. We love the medium & habenero. Kind of like a \"HIS & HERS package\". Thank you for your hard work guys! Keep up the hard work. Man what can i say, this salsa is the bomb!! i have all the different kinds. i have it with almost every meal. the owner is a cool dude, Hes dropped off free bottles to me in my mailbox. i stole the first bottle out of a friends fridge after i tasted and been hooked since. dont sleep on this hot sauce!! this sauce is so good with just about anything, i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles, it has a good burn with a strong flavor. im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon. buy it you wont regret it I never in my life tasted such a good babka its crazy good! This is the real babka! That my gram mother use to make I have a whole box of peanut butter dog cookies and she wont touch them. She loves these and begs for them so it was a good buy. She is a little chihuhua and they are not too big for her mouth. About 20 per box. My chihuahua loves these lil snacks. When she sees me bring out the yellow bus she literally runs in circles! I purchased these little treats as stocking stuffers for our little furry friends.  Both Yorkies LOVED these treats.  We had to finally buy more since they liked them so much. These are just like the animal crackers we eat.  The price is great and my little guy loves them! I tried this and I found it too salty.Plus I ate this fish sauce with some fish but I realized it was kind of redundant.Im kidding, of course. This stuff is great! I dont usually drink tea but I love this one. I thought the shipping price was a little high but love the tea so much that I had to get it. Perfect with a little bit of Honey. Cavenders makes the best vinegar and oil dressing ever. couple of tbls of cavenders and 1/4 vinager and 1/4 h2O, rest oil. good! Its balanced, its tasty, its filling, its good for you -- what more could you ask of a breakfast cereal?I still miss Kelloggs sister product, Just Right, which was a somewhat lighter blend (I loved it, they discontinued it), but Mueslix is a strong second-best. Dont know why I cant find these in my supermarket but I cant.  You get pack of 5 when you order.  Was afraid 5 boxes would last too long.  Instead found I need to order another 5-pack. I bought this product online because, although it is a Kellogg cereal, I cannot find a retail store which carries it, and incidentally I would like to know why. I called Kellogg and they could really give me no good answer, and suggested I try another product of theirs, which i found not as good as this. I appreciate that Amazon offers this, and I will continue to order it.  By the way,  it really keeps me \"regular\", better than any other cereal.  Try it, youll like it. This cereal is difficult to find in the stores so I appreciate being able to purchase it through Amazon.  My husband really likes it and looks forward to the delivering of it every month.  Seems like an unlikely thing to look forward to, but its the little things that count.  P. Looney You could find this in local supermarkets about 4 months ago but now it nowhere to be found. Every time Kelloggs makes a great cereal, they quit making it soon after. This is the case with Just Right, THAT WAS THE BEST STUFF ON THE PLANET! This has been my favorite cereal for probably 20 years.  The grocery stores stopped selling it, so Ive started buying it on the web in packs of 5 boxes.  I use them up pretty fast. I LOVE THIS CEREAL.  NOT ONLY DOES IT TASTE GOOD, ITS GOOD FOR YOU.  ITS A PITY THAT I CANT FIND THIS CEREAL IN ANY OF THE LOCAL SUPERMARKETS.  OTHER BRANDS DO NOT MATCH UP. Have been enjoying Mueslix since early 90s.  Some reason, I can not locate mueslix in local supermarkets in New York, so I order through Amazon.  Taste is perfect not so sweet.  I do not care too much about raisins but in this cereal I do enjoy greatly.  It is enjoyable way to supplement fibers with whole grain, a perfect breakfast that lasts until lunch time!  Tried all different kind & choices of many cereals out there but there is nothing like Mueslix; Amazons price may be higher than some grocery stores, but it isnt in my store so this is a good way to shop.I first tried this on a Princess cruise ship.  I found it is very good and filling.  It stays with me, which is very important.I am super please to find this! I almost cant stop eating this cereal...I eat it for breakfast and then in the evening, when I think I want something to eat and am really not hungry, I snack on these.  After all, its healthy, so long as I remembeer its not healthy to eat a cup or more.  Enjoy! Our local stores all stopped carrying this product and were putting their own imitation brands on the shelf......just not the same!  Great that I could order and have my cereal within days! Mueslix has been my favorite cereal since it came out years ago.  HOWEVER, they have (improved????) it by adding more raisins and nuts to the point of making it too rich!  I simply add about half of a grain cereal, such as cornflakes which also reduces the high price.  Stores keep discontinuing Mueslix to the point that it is hard to find!  Thank you Amazon! This cereal is hard to find in local stores where I live. My wife and I love this cereal for its taste and healthfulness. Whenever I find it in some hotel breakfast buffets, I am a happy man. I cannot think of eating any other cereal. Kelloggs Mueslix had replaced local muesli previously served in European B&Bs on our last trip. Not available locally, but Amazon provided with a fair price, rapid delivery and no shipping cost with my Prime Shipping. Excellent form of Muesli! Eating healthy never tasted so good. Tough to find in my local stores but Amazon has it at a great price especially through subscribe and save. The Kelloggs Muselix are delicious and the delivery was quick.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6KBSK\">Kelloggs Crispy Blend Mueslix Raisins, Dates & Almonds, 15.3-Ounce Unit (Pack of 5)</a> This cereal is the best cereal on the market.  It has many flavors, including nuts, raisins, dates, and especially a light malt flavor.  I have enjoyed it most mornings for years. I have been eating Kelloggs Mueslix for years. I love the mix of fruit, almonds, and whole grain. It used to be easy to find but when I couldnt find it in my local super markets, I was afraid it had been discontinued. When I found it on Amazon, I was pretty happy. It was a sad moment when I was unable to find my favorite cereal in the grocery stores.  Im not sure why it disappeared, but am so grateful Im able to purchace this online.  Thanks! its hard to find in the us my husband frm jamaica and he loves it he says it makes him fill full all day i get it every mo. My Mom who is in now New York, in an assisted living facility loves this ceral.  She was buying Kelloggs Mueslix when she lived in Florida, but when I went to buy it for her in NY where she is, I had no luck. I called Kelloggs themselves and they directed me to Amazon.com. I was so please that they sold the ceral and I can have it shipped for free to her. I also save money on each box and I also do not have to pay for the shipping. So now you have two happy people, my mom who gets her favorite ceral shipped directly every few months(they send 5 boxes)and me for saving money and time shopping and shipping the package to my mom. The Kellogg Mueslix Cereal was ordered one evening and just a couple of days later it arrived. The item was well packed. Contents were fresh. Encountered no problemsand plan to use this resource again. Local grocery stores dont carry this cereal so I order it. It is full of nuts, raisins, and other great stuff. I cut up a banana in it instead of adding sugar. My favorite box cereal. Just got the baby back ribs and the strips of jerky out of the smoker, wow this seasoning really added a lot of flavor, what was surprising was the fact that I knew I had added to much seasoning but it didnt turn out over powering. I would recommend this to anyone who is cooking any kind of meat, the jerky is great, but the ribs are outstanding, and for 27$ including shipping for 12lbs, awesome deal. I try every Asian salad dressing I can find.This is my favorite one for salads because of its delicate taste.My other favorite is \"Newmans Own, Low Fat Sesame Ginger\".The ginger in Newmans gives it a stronger flavor which is greatas a marinade or just sprinkle on rice and vege dishes. Wow, this is soooo good and has easily become my favorite dressing! I typically make my own dressings, however I do use this one as a treat!It was given to me as a gift and I absolutely love it! Its a perfect balance of sweet and oily and bitter. Granted, it needs a good shaking since its oil based! I absolutely love this and am sad I am running out! If you eat salads like me every day, then you will want this dressing! Its unique and I NEVER had somebody over who didnt love it! :) This coffee company delivers on great coffee taste!!  I like my coffee with deep, robust taste and Jeremiahs always is!!  It makes me glad to purchase it!!  Thanks!! I actually gave these to a local baker for my daughters cupcakes. They looked great. Showed up perfectly on white and chocolate icing. In great shape. This is the first time Ive used the coconut oil from Manila Coco Factory and I was so pleased with the taste, smell and overall incredible quality that I will buy more and recommend it to my family and friends.  I am so glad I tried it. I have been using coconut oil for several years and it has changed my life and health.  This oil ranks high in my book. Also, I liked ordering this product through amazon because they make it fast, easy and painless. Thank you for having this product on your site Amazon. I ordered the White Christmas, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Morning blends last year for the holidays and fell in love with the Christmas eve.  Its the smoothest of the bunch and has such a wonderful flavor, I use it for iced teas all year round.  I can honestly say that I never got into tea that much until I tried STASH teas.  I sent the licorice and lemon flavors to my father, and he called me to ask where Id gotten it, because his neighbor wanted to get some for his wife, too.  Once tried, you will be addicted. Visit the stashtea website for lots of tea related bits and baubles.  These make perfect hostess gifts over the holidays along with a plate of cookies. This is my very favorite tea of all. I drink it year-round and never get tired of it like I do of others. Its good any time of the day. Not too strong, but still nicely flavorful, with a good balance of minty/spicy/herbal-y. Christmas Eve tea (which does not actually contain tea) is not just for Christmas Eve. (Although if you are frazzled, it does releave the stress.) Christmas Eve is good any time. I do not know anyone who doesnt like it, and have often given it as gifts. It is especially nice in the winter when mint teas are a little too brisk and do not produce the same level of cozy comfort as Christmas Eve which is a soothing combination of spices and mint. It is almost as comforting as a cup of warm milk, but without the calories. Riba foods based in Houston, Texas makes this awesome black bean dip. It is pretty much all natural and without the lard that regular refried bean dip has in it. I am not sure why in Dallas TX its so hard to find - maybe because Riba has SO Many good flavors??? I make the traditional 7-layer dip with this instead of the refried beans, and am thinking about creating a breakfast quesadilla with this and some verde sauce. Try it, its not too too spicy but is very good! <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLXG\">Walkers Shortbread Highlander Shortbread Portion Pack, 1.4 Ounce Units (Pack of 24)</a>My family loves these! Its a great snack to carry in the car or its a wonderful surprise in a lunchbag. The flavor is so rich and pure...I forgot how wonderful these shortbread cookies were. And the price is nice, too...as well as Amazon.com. I love this place! Walkers Highlanders are my favorite purchased cookie, so it was great to find them pre-packaged into 2 biscuits. Keeps them fresh longer and limits my snacking! If you like Shortbread you will really like these. Walkers always makes the best Shortbread.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLXG\">Walkers Shortbread Highlander Shortbread Portion Pack, 1.4 Ounce Units (Pack of 24)</a> COULDNT FIND THESE ANYWHERE BUT ON LINE - IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT BECAUSE THEY ARE TRULLY GREAT TASTING COOKIES. Yes, these cubes are expensive; in fact, I almost gave them four stars for the expense.  Regardless, these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product.  Ive tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because Ive tried so many brown sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground/land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I dont know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier/sturdier than \"cut\" cubes by other producers.The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses-y flavor than other brown sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.  I wish I could describe the flavor better, but it has been several months since I was able to find a somewhat affordable supply.  BTW, now that this product is being sold with free shipping via Amazon Prime, I just purchased several boxes - it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago.  Recommended! We love these sugar cubes in the office.  They arent your grandmothers sugar cube.  They have a rugged appearance (can sugar cubes be considered rugged).  And we combine them with the white sugar cubes from La Perruche. Due to my husbands and sons inability to eat gluten, cornstarch is used very frequently in many gluten free recipes.  I am very concerned with the prolific use of GMOs in corn especially and my familys increased consumption of it.  I wanted to find an affordable GMO free cornstarch product to use in all my baking.  Rumford Natural Cornstarch is the one!  Ive been using it for months now with great success & satisfaction. If you love garlic, I recommend this flavored oil.  It is true to its name.  I was not expecting it to be so strong, so if I use it for cooking or dipping bread, I will mix it with some unflavored olive oil in the future. These things are AWESOME. Perfect size, truly wafer thin, consistent thickness of dark chocolate over minty interior. They are like what would happen if you could run a steamroller over a junior mint. I first tried them when I was living in Germany 16 years ago, and to this day no other mint comes close. And the copycat ones? Disgusting. Go for the original. You wont regret it. Each mint is in its own sleeve, so you can pass them out without ever touching one. Elegant and delicious. Love them! Love these mints.  They melt in your mouth and taste better than any others I have tried.  Just wish they werent so expensive.  You cant eat just one, a couple.  They are addictively delicious. I got it for my girlfriend. Very good stuff. Now everybody in the house eats them. Very hight quality if you are into chocolate and mint. A friends favorite candy is \"After Eight\", but they are not available anywhere in my area.  I couldnt find them on-line either.  Amazon.com came through.  These are imported from England and the most delicious peppermint.  These are so thin with a smooth mint cream center and a dark chocolate shell.  If you just want a little taste of mint, this is for you.  Really special with a cup of hot coffee! You will not find a better loose green tea for the price.  I was able to get free shipping as well since I bought it with something else that totaled over $25.  This is the tea used by many Japanese people.  Do not fall for those high-priced \"organic\" green teas produced by American companies.  They are good...but you are not getting anything better than Hime Ban Cha Tea. This is the favorite green tea in our household.  Been using it for years.  Was happy to find it here on Amazon, otherwise we had to travel about forty miles to an oriental grocery store to purchase it.  Cant even buy any leaf tea of any kind in regular grocery stores any more.  By the way \"Ban Cha\" in Japan simply means common or everyday tea.  Not ceremonial. I love this tea!! It is so flavorful yet there is no cut grass or off flavor as with some green teas. It is so mild that even left steeping it does not become bitter.It has a very mellow flavor that my kids enjoy too.Its great without sweeteners. It is a loose leaf tea and when steeped the leaves unfurl,long and slender. A little tea goes a long way. Enjoy! I have been drinking this green tea for sometime and was purchasing it when I was going to Syracuse every summer.  This year I stopped going there and didnt know where I was going to buy my tea until I spotted it on Amazon and purchased it.  I was so pleased  that I could get it, so I am now a happy camper once again. This is the real deal. Genmai Cha. Loose green tea and roasted brown rice. Not in bags. Originally known as the \"Peoples Tea\" for those who couldnt afford better. Very popular because of its mild flavor. You can drink it all day long (like I do). You wont be disappointed. Gatorade G2 is the way to go when you want the benefits of Gatorade without quite so much sugar. As I am in a \"pre-diabetes\" state these days, I am drinking this type of Gatorade instead of the regular Gatorade which has noticeably more sugar in it. The really good thing is that this still replenishes carbs and electrolytes after I exercise without putting unnecessary extra sugar into my system.G2 comes in flavors including fruit punch and grape.If youre on the go, the advantage of these bottles of Gatorade is this: because the bottles are smaller you can carry them with you much easier than if you took the regular, larger size bottles of Gatorade G2.I highly recommend this drink if you need extra carbs or electrolytes after exercising; it replenishes them very well without the extra sugar found in regular Gatorade. My partner is very happy with the tea, and is feeling much better since starting to drink it.She has been drinking it both hot (normal) and iced (chilled) and likes the refreshing nature of it. This tea won an award in the USA and I know why....\"Mandarin Silk Loose Leaf Oolong Tea\"  is like the name suggests \"Silk\" silk on your tongue.  A tea that has a warm, relaxing taste that makes you feel wonderful...Well done \"Art of Tea\"! These are identical to \"Jays hot chips\" (are they made by the same company?).  They have a slightly sweet taste, with a nice bit of heat. Definately not overwhelming heat, on a heat scale of 1-5, I would give these about a 2.  Regarding the texture, these are not kettle cooked chips, so they do not have much crunch, they are comparable to regular Lays chips.  For about $1 a bag, they are a great deal. I am from Michigan but have a vacation home in Canada. I have always been a fan of the primarily Canadian product \"ketchup chips\". Uncle Rays is a brand Ive seen around there frequently. Since this is such a hard to find product I expected to pay big bucks to buy it online. Imagine my surprise when I found these chips on Amazon for a little over a dollar a bag- CHEAPER than the retail I would pay in Canada. Unbelievably delicious! Ps. The dill pickle chips are really good too :) Mine came with stickers to sell them for $1.59 but they cost more like $1.25 so if for retail that is not much of a mark up. I bought these for myself so that doesnt really matter and they are cheap. Similar to Lays but cheaper. Unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips. Great product. Great price. Im not a potato chip addict, but sometimes like them as a snack.I chose these because Id never tried them before.They are delicious, zesty, slightly sweet and spicy.Its like a combination of sweet and tart at once. The oils in these chips are better for health. It is hard to put the bag down.They are made in Detroit Michigan and contain no trans fats, thats good enough for me. Try them. These are some of my favorite chips on the planet! They are light, crisp, & not too greasy. The flavor is very Dilly. Love that! Great chips. Just hard to find. These chips are really good. They taste better than other name brands. Theyre cheaper too!!  They arent too salty like other brands. The flavors blend really well. Just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in. Once I start eating them, its hard to stop!! LOLI will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand. Not sure if I can state the name brand or not. :) Not as thick as kettle chips we have had in the past, definitely more like a potato chip and the college crowd loves it.  Interestingly enough they feel more gourmet when eating these. The flavor is not heavily garlic while you can easily taste the cheese. I thought they were very good chips, delicious!  and as soon as i run out, ill be ordering more very soon. These are hard to find, but worth the trouble.  Very tasty and very reasonably priced.  Love the product, and received very quickly. I love uncle rays potatoe chips. They have alot of spice on each chip.  They taste spicy with a tang of sweet. When I order a box, I pass them out to friends who love them. My husband, my kids and I eat a whole bag at a time.  I limit myself to ordering only twice ayear. The salt content makes me blow up, but I still love them. I confess, I was originally looking at a different \"name\" brand, but they were out of the salt and vinegar, which is the only flavor I eat.  I had never even heard of Uncle Rays, let alone tried them, but the price was reasonable and it helped me qualify for free super saver shipping.  I am happy to say I was very pleasantly surprised with these chips.  Somehow or another, even though they just seem to be in a normal box, when I opened that first bag I had a nice mix of big chips and little chips.  The salt and vinegar blend well, so much so that the flavors sometimes sneak up on you-- it sometimes seems that with the first crunch you taste salt and the second crunch gives the vinegar.  In any case, theyre terrific.  I was a little reluctant about buying a somewhat large quantity of an unknown product, but Im very glad I took the chance. Its difficult to purchase \"no-salt\" potato chips at most retail stores, so I ordered a case of 3 ounce bags of Uncle Rays.  They are great.  Not oily and they taste great.  You get the potato flavor instead of just salt.  Ill be buying these from now on! Who doesnt like vegetables that are portable and at a great price?  Cant beat the convenience at about 4 cents per package! Everything AmeriColor that I have purchased works great! I was looking for some lighter tone colors, everything I had was pretty bright. These sheen colors are light with a pretty sheen, its great! Thank you! I love the metallic and sheen colors.  In a photo, the items airbrushed with the silver and gold look real.  The sheen really kicks the color up a notch. ordered these for my daughters wedding cake overnight so that i would get them the next daythey came four days after weddingbut they are nice If youre looking at Choice tea, youre probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic, fair trade ingredients for tea.But Choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations. As for design, Lychee White is part of Choices new line, characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid-shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves. As for creative ingredient combinations, this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms. The flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate. Sent very prompty, tea is delicious, will continue to use this company with great enthusiasm. I loved this tea! It is refreshing and delicious with or without sweetener. A great buy! I would definitely recommend this product! 3 boxes, under $6 each for all cherry - great buy.  I couldnt find all cherry in the store and dont really care for the other flavors. Nice combination of ingredients so that it is VERY hot, yet still has great flavor. It has a little added sugar, which adds a nice bit of sweetness to the mix. For the hotter salsas, you really cant go wrong with this. This is one of my top four favorites, which include Mrs. Renfros hot salsa, Screaming Sphincter and Pain is Good #37. I am very acustom to spicy foods and this has a very rich flavor. Half the bottle was devoted to given people my \"not so hot salsa \" reactions amazing . Worth the money! as for me eating it the title says it all My cats (7 of them) love this food so I was glad to see Amazon is carrying it again. The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.5lbs and 12 lbs. This food is sealed very well, and is fresh. I have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food, and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats. This food does not \"rifle\" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives brand and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free.I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust. In the end, I think you will be very pleased with the quality and price.Also, we used to take in foster cats, and fed them this 9 Lives brand, and they all did very well. my cats favorite cat food he is very pickey and will not eat a lot of different cat foods but he loves this one I used to buy this at Target but its cheaper at Amazon.My cat goes crazy when I get out the bag so I know she loves it. Cheap to boot, also!I dont really stress out about which exact ingredients are in cat or dog food. I figure its all pretty decent so why not save a little money... There are 4 kittens that started hanging outside the house and I started feeding them.  Rather than buying the smaller bags, this is a great value for multiple cats.  The kittens love the food and always look forward to eating it.  Shipped right to your door.  Cant go wrong with that! My cats love this food. For the money it is a great product. I get it every month.  The cats love the flavor. I have 6 feral cats that I trapped, neutered/spayed and released.  They still hang around our property so of course we feed them.  They really like 9 lives and I believe it is good for them.  Being old and my husband handicapped, it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of wrestling with the bags at the store and unloading when we get home.  I am very satisfied with the product and Amazon.  The subscribe and save option is even better as I dont have to remember to order it. My two cats love this cat food more than the kirkland signature brand.  Its also very cheap and affordable cat food at walmart. I would recommend this cat food over meow mix or friskies any day.  Get 9lives dry cat food.  Its one of the better brands out there. One of my kitties is a complete snob when it comes to food and she loves this. Great product to buy. i love these pop.  these are rather small pops about 1/2 the size of a tootsie pop.  they come in many flavors.  i think this bag is great in the long run.  300 just think Halloween. dum dum lolly pops are the best! they come i lots of kinds and tast really good! This stuff is great if youre looking for a non-alcoholic vanilla extract...yes this is really a vanilla extract not just a flavor like the essence stuff. I read somewhere on the net that the only reason they cant call it an extract is because it wasnt extracted by alcohol so legally they have to call it a flavor.The smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified, the texture is a little bit like honey, I think its the glycerin.Going to buy again for sure. Not paying attention, I thought this product was simply vanilla extract when I purchased it, tried it in my coffee, and got a shock. Yummy!  I had to go examine the bottle, and realized my yummy mistake.  I wonder what glycerin is, what its made of...? is it a fat?At any rate, it is delicious! I prefer the taste of this over the alcohol-based vanilla extracts, particularly in uncooked items and beverages. It has a fairly thick/syrupy consistency. Raw, Organic, Fair Trade, Tastes Great... Whats not to love? My hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit. Excellent in cereal, or on top icecream sundae. I use them in my ramen noodle hot/sour soup as well.  very very GOOD.  almost a lite peanut flavor.  not too much salt, very lightly seasoned. a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of protien into diet.  even the dog loves them. thinks they are some special treat. Bought this for my mom for her birthday, she was dying to open it so we could all try it. It was nice and fresh and everything tasted great! Wish I had bought one for myself! These dates were absolutely delicious. I was a little bit worried because the one product review that it had was only one star. But as I looked at all the other date reviews, the trend seemed to be bad reviews in the Fall timeframe. I had these delivered mid-January and must say they were quite exquisite. Many thanks for a great treat at a large dinner party. I have nine cats and they are crazy about these kibbles! The last thing you want is 20lbs of cat food the cats hate, but Ill be buying them more of this... I have used your product for years and find myself in a town where they are sold only in very small bottles.  I am used to buying your product by the half gallon and would like to make my purchases online.  I have tried using other products which pale in comparison to your Original Barbecue Sauce. If you like soft licorice, these cats arent for you.A perfect anise-y balance of salty and sweet, these little licorice kitties are perfect! You pop one (or several) in your mouth and let them melt a bit before you embark on your flavorful chewy journey.Hard exterior. Lasts forever if you suck on them. Everlasting licorice Katjes!!Very fresh. Super fast shopping too. Thank you guys! Very firm small pieces with an intense licorice flavor. I love black licorice and have been trying different gluten free options. I will be ordering more of this one. These tomatoes taste like home canned. When summer is over and heirloom tomatoes no longer are available at the farmers market, these serve as an excellent reminder of the past season and a promise of the next. I originally bought these organic tomatoes for my stepfather, whose heart disease dictated a low sodium diet. And they are incredibly low in sodium. But I soon bought them for myself after I tried them just once. When the local organic grocery store and then Sprouts stopped carrying them, I turned to Amazon for a case. They are as much a staple in my pantry as olive oil. the ingredients are simple and pure and one of the few brands that does not add unnecessary additives.  Generally I like to make my own sauce from scratch, but this is my second choice if I am short on time.  Its taste good and not artificially sweet.  I love the bionaturae products including the tomato paste. These are the best canned tomatoes I have tasted. They have a fresh flavor, similar to home-canned. This is my second time buying a set. They are a little more acidic/bright, and have a rounder flavor than other tomatoes. Comes with a basil leaf in each can. Note, the 28 oz tins are a better value than the 14 oz ones. Well one of my friends asked for a really big bag of gummy bears, she was very pleased when she opened the box. Than her co-worker really like these gummy bears to. I have been eating these since about 5 years old and are my favorite chips in the world! just dont eat too many of them! I love these chips and couldnt contain my happiness when I recieved my box!! Love them, if you love spicy foods...get these!! I used these and a bunch of other colored lollipops for a friends birthday and she got a kick out of it.  She had been complaining about feeling old so we threw a kid themed party.  She had a great time.  I dont think its possible to eat one of these spiral lollipops without feeling like a kid! I used these lollipops for a candy princess costume for my daughter. They came in perfect condition and exactly like the picture shows. They do come in a group of 16...such a great value! I was extremely satisfied! I had purchased these to go along with a Candyland costume for Halloween.  They shipped quickly and were packaged securely with bubble wrap.  None of the lollipops were broken in transit.It turns out the costume I ordered (from another seller) didnt fit at all and was made of very cheap material so I couldnt even alter it to fit.  Since I had to return the costume, I requested to return these as well.  I was immediately fully refunded without even being asked to ship the lollipops back, so the five stars are so the amazing service.Now I think well hand out the lollipops with the rest of our Halloween candy, which I think the kids in our neighborhood will love! I bought these lollipops for my daughters 3rd Birthday. They are super cute and the kids loved them. Definitely met my expectations. I got these for my sons 3rd birthday. I got it because I am doing a candy station for his birthday & I wanted to put colorful lollipops as part of the candy station. So this is just perfect for my idea. I used this for my daughters candy land birthday party and the kids loved them! They arent full size, but they are still sooooo cute!!! Bought these for a birthday and they were perfect--all arrived uncracked and wrapped really well. Super cute and perfect for 4 year olds. I ordered the lollipops for party favors at my sons 1st birthday party.  The lollipops are 2 inches and I used 1.5 inch \"thank you\" stickers on them.  So cute!  The description states that 16 lollipops are included in the order.  I ordered 2 boxes and only received 12 lollipops in each box.  I contacted the sellers customer service.  I received a response and apology right away.  They promptly corrected the order.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive another full box of 12 and not just the 8 I expected.  The lollipops are wrapped in bubble wrap.  Out of three boxes only one lollipop was cracked.  Not a big deal to me since I did receive an extra box.  Great lollipop at a great price. comical that this is considered a toy.  I bought these as a decoration for a circus themed baby shower and they arrived in perfect condition. I used them in vases surrounded by colored crinkle cut paper and used as centerpieces on the buffet table.  Lots of compliments.  I have kept them and plan to use again for future parties.  these will  not be consumed so no idea how they taste... These arrived securely packaged, not even a chip on one lollipop.  They also tasted really good and looked very pretty at my sisters baby shower.  I would buy these again for myself and suggest to future buyers! I love Salsa and have tried many on the market. I served Dippin Fiesta at a recent Sunday football get together and got rave reviews. Maybe the best Salsa I have ever tasted and served. If you want to taste the best, try this one. I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they arent! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and theyre just as fabulous cold.Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong. I made these recently for a holiday party.  I have never seen anything go so fast!They were very easy to make-- just add a few ingredients, mix, and throw them in the oven.  I will definitely be buying and making these again. These are not as good at Houstons Samba Grill but they tasted great. The texture is different but in lieu of having these on a daily basis, I have found something that I can make. I would surely recommend these to anyonr. Since being gluten free Ive tried all types of GF breads and they are all very expensive. Who knew that the brazilians had the bread game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese bread! Its custom which is probably why they are all so skinny! lol But I loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more! My item got to my house on time and I was surprised on how well my package was packed. I recommend this store to anyone;) Despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here (see the ingredient list on the Omaha site), but.... that is not a bad thing in this case. They are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious. Our kids just love them. We serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal. 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering:Calories: 120Fat: 4.5Trans Fat: 0Sodium: 270Carbohydrate: 17Protein: 3For our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under 5 fat & 25 carb. This fits perfectly & the taste is superb. Baked in the oven, they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. All with no grease. We now keep these on hand instead of french fries. I know they cost more, but they taste better and they are so much healthier. We wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time. Perfect year round with just about any meat dish, these Omaha Steaks Twice Baked Potatoes are a gourmet delight. The consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon, peppers and cheese add to the explosion of flavor.  They cook easily in either the conventional oven, or on the grill when wrapped in foil!  Go ahead, treat yourself! I love to order these type of cooked potatoes and they are so great with a steak... Very good side dish, easy to make, easy to eat.  As others have said, needs a little spice, but other than that they are delicious! excellent - will order again!!  Its nice to be able to order Omaha items from Amazon because Amazon ships SOOO fast, and payments are so convenient. I was surprised at the size of these potatoes. I have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small. These are perfect!! Tasty, cook just right. Love em!! These potatoes are really very good.  My husband and I both *love* them.  And way too easy.  We will be buying more of these. I got these in the mail today, i know right, sounds so weird to say i got hash browns in the mail, haha.  Come in dry ice cooler and were in box all in their own lil plastic bags.  Just stick them on a baking sheet for 35 min. at 400 degrees.  when you get them out of the oven you smell the cheese and it has nice crunchy outside with creamy potato inside, if you want the best side dish to your steak or other meat, hey could even use for breakfast with some eggs and sausage, your choice, this get a 5/5 for taste, 5/5 for presentation, buy these now, great price too, thanks for your time, and thank you omaha steaks, the best at great prices. So so good!  Delicious, easy to prepare food!  I would definitely order again.  Had a gourmet taste, and took only minutes to get ready.  Yum!!! These potatoes are pretty good. They can be eaten alone or served with a meal. Really like potatoes and this is an easy choice. I prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven. They are the perfect compliment to a hamburger, steak or chicken entree. Try them. Youll like them! Very good transaction and Omaha food was sent properly.  I already left one feedback. These potatoes are very good along with all their steaks and hamburgers.  I would definately recommend Omaha Steaks to anyone looking for a gourmet dinner at a reasonable price! Im a big fan of Outburst Energy Bites, and the peanut ones are probably my favorite. Theyre reasonably priced and a great snack. Think of peanut M&Ms and a coffee all at once. Since they taste so good, it is very tempting to eat the whole box. They claim its a lot of caffeine, but it doesnt feel like more than a big coffee or a large energy drink, so I usually give in to the temptation!I highly recommend these! ENERGY BITES FING RIP YOUR FACE OFF WITH MOLTEN LAVA ENERGY.INFINITY ENERGY TO THE FING MAX.  I ATE A WHOLE BOX ONCE AND THREW A CAR AT A BABY.FING RAVE.SERIOUSLY THESE ARE GREAT. I originally found this Roasted Garlic Juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs, plants and ice cream. That was about a year ago and unfortunately, the place is now out of business. I was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on Amazon, as I couldnt find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50-mile radius. Store Managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice. I told them if they carried it, they would sell a lot.I have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor cant be beat! It is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine. I prefer the Roasted over the Cold Pressed, but both are great in their own way. Its nice to be able to pour or spray.Bottom line: If you are a garlic lover, buy this!!!!! I love my garlic spray so much, that i ordered more! I grow garlic, but I dont even bother juicing them anymore, not with this product. There are 150 cloves in every bottle. Thats a lot of yummy garlic... I love the taste of real garlic - not the granulated or brined stuff. These are great flavoring agents, especially for popcorn as a liquid in glazes and rubs. Love the choice between roasted and raw, and a little goes a long way. I first bought this product 2 years ago. Despite using one or the other at least once a week, I am only now needing to replace them.Yum! I had heard about their prickly pear tea in a forum and decided to try it since I hadnt had any since I was in Arizona.  It was better than I remembered!  I tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good.  The company delivered super fast too which was great.  I recommend this tea highly, particularly if you like prickly pear teas. Butternut Mountain Maple Syrup is the real deal. The grade B is wonderful on pancakes, or in coffee- just about on anything youd like sweetened.Delivery was timely and the product came as expected. I recommend this! I just received my shipment and could hardly wait to try this product. We love &quot;slickers&quot; which is what we call them, instead of stickers because they can be removed so easily. My daughter designed signs to be  printed in reverse to use on her car windows. They printed beautifully (we  have The Print Shop program). I am going to have a lot of fun with this  product because there are windows everywhere and other surfaces like tv  screens and computer monitors. This was a really good idea and the final product is outstanding. I use the decals on my car window and everybody asks where i bought the decals i made.  Two thumbs up! After years of drinking Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster and some others, I have found the holy grail of energy drinks. It kicks in within 2-3 minutes and it lasts an entire work day. After seven hours or so, you gradually come down. There is no anxiety or disphoria when it wears off. You just get very sleepy when you finally rest.Redline Power Rush is the very best product on the market. If it were illegal I would buy it on the black market. Nuff said. The normal 15oz can is too much SPAM for one person.  The 7oz version is perfect for me to make two sandwiches.  I cut the block in half.  Each half I cut into 4 slices.  The 4 slices are perfect to lay on top of a toast.  With some salad green and 2nd toast, it becomes a quick and filling lunch sandwich when I hike or backpack (need sodium to replace electrolyte).  The 2nd half will become my 2nd sandwich if I do overnight backpacking (for dinner). Our family loves SPAM and Amazon makes it so easy and such a great deal to buy in bulk.  The 7-ounce size is perfect for our use.  Amazing what you can use SPAM for.  Add it to all your favorite recipes in place of other meats!  Super convenient to have it come in automatic shipments without having to give it a second thought! Its a long time since Ive eaten Spam but I decided to give it a try. I always had left overs before but with this size can I simply enjoy every bit in one serving. Well worth the price.  Very large chocolate truffles that taste amazing.  Cant wait for Amazon to get them again.  1 January 2012. Just browsed to the truffle page and had a mini heart attack when I saw the price.  They were $12.00 when I purchased them in 2011. Excellent product.  Crab Cakes made with lump style crabmeat has been a family tradition during Christmas holidays for over 40 years.  Local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancy/minced crab meat which is OK but not as satisfatory as lump style. THESE TREATS ARE THE ONLY ONES MY 14 YEAR OLD DOG WILL EAT. SHE LOVES THEM. She will play with it before eating it.  Since she is small it acts like a tiny ball for her.  They are expensive, but less so at Amazon than at a pet store. I have three small dogs and these are one of their favorite treats!  I dont have to worry about them choking and I feel I am giving them a healthy treat!  Please dont ever stop making them Pet N Shape. Terrific with English Triffle.  Beware though the pack of 6; each of the 6 containers makes about a gallon of pudding. After youve made the customary, authentic English trifle with Birds custard powder you might not want to go back to the usual grocery-store pudding packages. I DID purchase a large quantity of Birds custard power, the pack of six, but the packs have a longish shelf life, and I enjoyed sending a surprise pack/container to a friend who is originally from England.At Christmas, I will also include a container of Birds custard powder to special relatives and friends so they can learn how easy it is to make excellent trifle with this product. For my non-English family and friends, I will include laminated instructions based on my own successes with Birds custard recipe for trifle.English trifle is so easy to make with the following:  Birds custard powder, store-bought pound cake, thawed frozen fruit, some sherry wine (or slightly sweetened juice from the thawed frozen fruit) poured over the small slices of cake. For the final touch, add non-dairy whipped \"creme.\" Delicious and inexpensive! I highly recommend this product and am so pleased to be able to purchase it through Amazon. And the price for the six  containers is so very reasonable as to almost be unreal. Go for it! We found this on our recent trip to England and had to find it as soon as we got home.Its a standard for the Brits, and for us now too.  Its been around FOREVER.You can use it in so many ways; pies, trifle, donuts,cakes, by itself with fresh fruit and whipped cream, or even on french toast! I am from England and I was raised on this custard. If you like vanilla custard/pudding you will love this. Its rich and creamy and has lots of vanilla taste.  I love that it comes in a big canister and I can make as much as I want to. I would never make a trifle with anything else. This is a great product, we have made custard with it for years and it always makes great custard. We will purchase this product again. Amazon does a great job of getting us our purchases fast and without damage. life without birds custard has been hell ! ive tried other varieties-sthg from holland if i recall correctly-just not up to snuff...i ordered 6 to ensure i never run out ! better than ice cream and not half as fattening. I purchased this product because I have previously used it and it is not always easy to locate on store shelves.  I prefer it to other powdered custard(pudding) products for ease of making and taste. Its wonderful in trifles or just about any pudding type dessert you want to make. Amazon gets the product to you almost immediately and at a reasonable price. Hard to find locally. Great price, especially with the free shipping.  Have enough to share with family and friends. This is a wonderful and very handy product.  Im thrilled by all the yummy ways this can be used.  My aunt, who lived in Ireland for 7 years, said they used it all the time and loved it. I actually use this mix to make vegetable biryani and it works well for this purpose,  with some slight adjustments to the recipe.I do have one caveat about the product, but its about the recipe given, not the spice mix. I think the amount of ghee it is suggested you use (200 grams) is too much, and you can easily use 100 grams instead. Also, I think its easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying.To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee.Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani Ive had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them. And the price makes this an incredible deal--there are 2 bags per package and there are 6 packages, so this makes 12 large batches for ~$13 with free shipping. I will definitely order more when I run out. Anytime I have started to get even the slightest sore throat, I drink this and the next morning its gone. I always bought it at World Market, but they said it has been discontinued. But, thank God for Amazon! This tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too.  Make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say.  It really seems to help you to feel better. A friend sent me two boxes of this for Christmas.  I thought it an odd gift, as I can just go out and buy herbal tea.  Shortly thereafter, I was flung into major stress and chaos during an extreme family crisis. I started drinking this tea to help with unexpected stomach pains and it worked!  Not only that, during this time, other family members got physically ill, but I was able to carry on without catching the bug.  Since then, Im a believer.  I make this as iced tea for daytime and drink a cup at night before bed. In cold weather, I brew this tea by the pot, keep it simmering, and brew a lemon ginger or ginger lemon tea, by the cup, made with this as the base.  My husband will drink it, and I cant get him to use any other medicinal.  (Hates licorise.)  It helped a great deal last winter. Have bought this from the folks who prepare it and I must say, this is the absolute best item I have ever tasted. They make this at a farm in Benson, AZ and it tastes like heaven. Highly recommend it for everything...I tend to slice up apples and dip them. Have tried it on toast as well. Ive been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top-quality. The bite-size bits are perfect for training and dont muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended! My 2 dogs love this treat.  When my oldest (male) was younger, he would sit down, stand up, go down, roll over, etc. and do every trick in his repertoire before I even gave him a command whenever I pulled out a bag of the liver biscotti.  My female also loves this but shes a little less silly.  Also, this has never upset their stomachs nor caused allergic reactions.  I finally had to find a place that sold this in bulk (i.e., 5 lbs. bags) since I was going to the store ALL the time to buy more of these.  I also stuff their Kongs with a combo of these and their regular kibble and some pumpkin and freeze it. I highly recommend this treat. Five of my five dogs agree - theyd rather munch liver biscotti than almost anything else.  I pull out a treat and they come running.  It cheers em up, encourages them to obey, lets em know I love em, and got me over some really rough training spots with my 90 pound puppy!!!  And in a few instances when Ive been slow producing the goodie, theyve cornered me and dug in my pocket themselves!  I think its a hit! Our dog loves these treats.  We sprinkle a few into his regular dry dog food, and he gobbles everything up as fast as he can.  We also use them as rewards for good behavior.  Wonderful, nutritious, really good to have on hand at all times. Lucy loves these treats as does her friend, Daisy - I do not know what else to say to fill up the 210 word minimum. My dog will do anything for these treats. Buying a five pound bag lasts about a year and they are dry so they are easy to put in your pocket and they last forever. Despite what many say and think about bulldogs, ours are picky about their snacks.  They love the liver biscotti which can be a hand-fed treat or used in a treat ball.  They last longer than most snacks and because our bullies dont often chew their food, these are the perfect size.  I dont feel bad about feeding these either because they are low calorie and without fillers. Our dog named \"Big Red\" loves your liver biscoti and the closest store was 54 miles round trip. I am not too keen on driving that far so I found your mail service on the internet. Now our 8 pound poodle gets his treats again! Theyre perfect training treats for my dogs.  They go to the place where theyre stored and stand there until I get a handful for our play games. even my vet approves. these little treats are my dogs favorite. i just get the small ones because i have a small dog. My dogs go crazy over Liver Biscottis. They are nice and crunchy which helps clean their teeth and all the ingredients are wholesome. My dog would have to stop breathing before she would fail to perform for Liver Biscotti. Even my friends with finicky dogs are surprised how their dogs love the stuff. If there is one thing our dog likes, it is the liver biscotti dog treats.  These make the best rewards and training treats we have used. As another reviewer mentioned, these treats are CRUNCHY!. I like them for 2 reasons..my dog cant just \"woof them down\", she has to chew them, so they last..and I like that the cruchiness may be good for her teeth. The treats are small, but again, are crunchy...Im glad I found these. She loves them and I like giving them to her. I have two dogs that absolutely love these treats!  The 5lb bag size that I purchased is very convenient and long lasting.  The vendor that I purchased them from is very thorough; several emails were sent updating me on the status of my order and its upcoming delivery. The price was extremely reasonable.  The best part is the fact that my pups adore these treats and they are good for them to nibble on throughout the day.  A guilt free doggie reward! Our Portuguese Water Dog has been trained on these bite sized little treats. He loves them and will do anything for them.  Good Dog! Our four dogs love this stuff! This bite size treat is a perfect size for training. The dogs like the crunch - its shaped like a small square crouton. There is enough in this huge bag to make little gift bags for friends with dogs. The ultimate treat for dogs of all sizes.  Our dogs are absolutely crazy for Liver Biscotti.  We love the size of this treat, it makes it very easy to use them as daily treats and not worry that you are over feeding.  The size is also great for using as bait for conformation showing.We love the fact that all natural ingredients with no preservatives are used.  All you have to do is open the bag and smell whats inside.  It smells so good, you might be tempted to try one too.We love the 5 pound bag.  Having multiple dogs, this bag really is a cost saver.  Youll see significant savings over buying the small 8oz bags.It also makes a great gift for your dog loving/owning friends, spread the joy of Liver Biscotti! A fantastic product for pet treats,great smell and has freeze-dried liver treats beat by leaps and bounds. Owner of 2 fussy cockers. OMG these things are delicious!@ Im not a candy/sweets eater usually.. but ... OhMan! I liked them so much I may have had , two.. oops, now three! I was just messing around on amazon when I ran into this add for beer nuts, when I noticed someone had left a review it was pretty funny, being the beer lover that I am, I had to try them,  well theyre here now and I cant drink beer without them, they have a story on the back about how the guy got started in the 50s, and soon his beer nuts were in bars around america!  iIcan see why, theyre pretty darn good. i used to eat beer nuts all the time as a kid.  sorta like honey roasted peanuts, but more unique flavor.  if you never triedem, if you like honey roasted peanuts, youll love these! great product! wish they were still available in bars,pubs,and stores.have given cans to several of my golf buddies and they agree with me. im just glad they are still available on line. Some reviewers must have a short memory. Ive been eating Beer Nuts since childhood and the ones I ordered tasted like they always have (sweet and salty). Bought them locally until I couldnt find them anymore. Great product and price for 6/12oz cans. this is the second time ordering beer nuts....i can not find them anywhere in local stores.  the shipment came (6 cans per order) and 2 cans were damaged.  called amazon customer service and the next day another 6 cans appeared at my door.the nuts are always great (unless can is damaged and nuts are stale) but the customer service was the shining star.  thank you !!  will order again My husband is a Beer Nut lover. Looked in many storesand could only find small bags. Love these large cans. Not always available at our local stores. I love them. They are especially good watching football games, with you favorite malt beverage. This is a good deal, and super fast delivery, too. The nuts were fresh and tasty, as always. These are the long time classic.  Not as sweet as honey roasted peanuts, these have just the right balance to go with a nice cold brew.  Amazons price on these is really great. This is the good stuff! I am eating some right now with some sweet basil tomato sauce. This pasta has a neat shape and it cooks up nicely. Its colorful and tasty and is great \"al dente\". All of the Castellana pastas are absolutely wonderful.  They have a great taste, hold their unique shapes, grab lots of sauce in your dishes, and have a nice \"bite.\"  This is a great price for this item! *****Oh, I love this pasta! It is thick, chewy, absolutely extraordinary! And made with authentic flavorings to boot! The red are flavored with tomato and red beet powder. The green are flavored with spinach powder and basil powder. The black pastas are flavored with squid ink, the off-white are au naturale. The yellow pasta are flavored with turmeric, the orange with carrot powder. A rainbow of beauty and natural delectable flavor.The pasta are shaped like little cresent moons with a rough exterior to absorb whatever sauce or oil you might use. Because this pasta is so very flavorful, I enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some Celtic sea salt. Sometimes I add some tarragon or fresh rosemary, usually not, so I can just savor the pasta alone. It also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated Parmesan chees on top.With only 1g of fat, 10g of sodium, this can also be a heart-healthy meal. There are 7g of protein and 42g of carbos, no added sugars or preservatives.It is the perfect easy dish to impress company or a date!To be able to buy the best packaged pasta in the whole wide world at HALF PRICE in bulk from Amazon is a wonderful privilege. You will not be disappointed.***** Yes, its expensive, but its worth it!  I have yet to find a marinade that stands up to this one.  Add some crushed garlic, sauteed onions and vegetables of your choice, then mix it all with this sauce and whatever meat you choose (I prefer using the resulting marinade by adding some fresh rosemary and lamb) for two days.  You wont believe the oohs and aahhhs you get at the table...worth every penny! Its not a traditional BBQ sauce in terms of flavor, but you could easily use it for that. Its very thick and has a strong hotness (not too hot - but hotter than most spicy BBQ sauce) and its made from much better ingredients than most BBQ or sweet hot sauces. It tastes very fruity rather than sugary sweet. It would be great on almost anything grilled or stir fried, and its incredible in pork and beans. Dont let the price scare you away from this outstanding condiment. Its always wonderful to be able to give chocolates as a gift and to receive them.  Its great to know that you can send someone  some chocolates with the guarantee that they dont arrive all melted.  Good Service and Excellent chocolates! We love strawberries dipped in chocolate but locally we could not find the dark chocolate type - so glad we found this at Amazon - it is WONDERFUL! Best dipping chocolate ever! I dipped strawberries, pretzels marshmallows its wonderful. My whole family loves them. Great to bring out to friends or occasions! Dont forget the wax paper, otherwise it will stick to your plate! I have tried a couple of different cocao powders but this one is a step above the other ones.  The richness of the bean has a dark smooth flavor within the powder.  It is just a better product This cocoa powder has a deep, fruity taste- I highly recommend it.  I recently bought a vitamix blender, which means that I now make 5 smoothies a day.  This cocoa powder, plus some almond milk, frozen fruit, yogurt, and a dash of maple syrup, makes an excellent \"milk shake\".  Disclaimer: I like 99.9% of all chocolate, so take this positive review with a grain of salt. Almost identical to Ghiradelis great chocolate taste...but raw!organic! The best!!! I also whip it into whipped up sprouted almonds with Strvia and make ball/snacks from it, yummmm This was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and I was pleasantly surprised!  The item was packed and shipped professionally and I love the resealable bag.  I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didnt taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable/fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas...  I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals youll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if youre looking to purchase it. Raw Cacao Powder differs greatly in taste than processed Cacao Powder. Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isnt. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens. This powder, and this company, are both superb. There was a small problem with the order and they handled it in such a gracious manner that I will be a customer forever. This is a very tasty cacao powder.  It arrived in an unmarked bag (does not have an organic symbol or product description) but it seems to be the real deal.  Good flavor, similar to or better than name brand powders I have purchased in the past.  Will definitely purchase again. bought as gift for hard to buy for father...he LOVED  bread said it was delicious !! WONDERFUL PRODUCT.ALL THE BREAD MIXES I HAVE TRIED ON AMAZON ARE NOT DISAPPOINTING!!!WILL BE BACK FOR MORE.  THEY WILL MAKE GREAT CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a certain age (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon; this cannot be found in \"store bacon\" anymore.  Modern bacon is thin, lightly/poorly smoked - even the so-called gourmet bacon.  This is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the \"good old days.\"  Arrives nice and cool in an ice pack - cheaper if you buy the 12-pack. Love this, dont use too much because it is strong, but it tastes great.  Makes even mediocre salmon taste great. These are thin,crisp, fragrant cookies and are very delicious and tasty. They are excellent with a glass of cold almond milk or hot herbal tea. (my choices) If you like ginger snaps you will love Lars ginger snaps. These ginger cookies are it...I dont have to look anymore ...I have found THE cookie ...I ate the entire box and did not share...so hubby said when I order more I have to get 2 boxes cause he would like to have some..:) Very good.  Very tasty and authentic flavor!  I ordered these last minute for Christmas, not knowing if they were going to arrive on time.  They arrived at my house on Christmas Eve. Didnt have time to make these this year so I thought I would buy them. I never buy cookies, but these I would buy again. My son loved them. The only thing I had to do was dip them in white chocolate.Thanks After finding out two of our family members have celiac disease, we had to give up licorice and cherry nibs.  Candy Trees Organic Cherry Bites have no sugar and truly rival the cherry nibs with gluten.  After a year of not having the \"real thing\" my husband believes Candy Trees are actually better. This licorice has very good taste.  My daughter is on a gluten free diet and she loves these cherry bites. This dressing became an instant favorite of mine.  Its fat free without losing the flavor.  Alot of other dresings lose alot of flavor in their fat free versions, and that only makes you have to use twice as much.  Wish Bone is now my only choice for Ranch dressing.  My husband doesnt usually go for fat free or diet anything, but I put this on our salads and he didnt even know! If I had not purchased this salad dressing myself, I never would have guessed it was fat free. Served it with fresh vegetables during Thanksgiving pre-dinner, and it was a definite hit with the guests too. Like the flavor and its thick, unlike some fat free dressings that are really runny. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ODRY9I\">Wish Bone Fat Free Ranch Salad Dressing, 16-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)</a>This is a great salad dressing...tastes just as good and is as flavorful as the regular fatfull dressing. The price is pretty good given that local stores sell one bottle for almost $4. Dont know why the price on this has gone up though. My doc has strictly limited me on what I can and cannot eat. I can use this salad dressing and was pleased to find it in bulk at a great price. Good taste. WANT TO TASTE SOMETHING DIFFERENT?  THEN YOU ARE COMING TO THE RIGHT PLACE.  I JUST LOVE THE SMOOTHNESS  AND FLAVOR OF THE RANCH DRESSINGNOW GET ON YOUR HORSES (OR MULES) AND ORDER SOME TODAY. This is a very smooth tea from Argo Tea.  I was so excited when they came to NYC, and I bought a bag of this tea to make at home.  It has an almondy/chocolatey flavor (but not overpowering).  Its a great tea for everyone, including people just starting to drink tea.  I love it in a Latte (I just microwave some milk and use that instead of water). If you like jasmine tea, This is a great tea! Its lite not, overly medicine tasting like jasmine tea can be. Its also fun to watch the tea leaves unfurl... I steep it so many times that until I lost count.. haha. Just Great . We received a box of these at work and the whole package was gone moments after opening it up!  Great biscuits and now I am ordering a couple boxes for a few gifts for people I cant figure out what to get... Of all the flavors of tic tacs, these are my favorite.  Great wild cherry flavor. Love them!! Too bad they arent more readily available to purchase locally. These little buggers are tough to find so I was happy to get a big pack at a good price online.  My daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at 2 calories a piece, not all that unhealthy. Definitely would reorder these again.  I think it would be better if they were offered in a bigger pack.  My kids love these.  Great little Valentines Day gifts.  Great stocking stuffers. I bought them for a friend because she loves the cherry ones and theyre hard to find. I kept half for myself. I admit, gone in no time. Everyone knows what a Tic Tac is, but let me tell you something; if you like orange tic tacs, youre going to LOVE wild cherry tic tacs!  Very cherry flavored with just enough of a mix of sweet and sour.  Do yourself a favor and try some. I love these Wild Cherry Tic Tacs and they are impossible to find in stores.  I am so glad that I can get them from Amazon and the price is excellent!  They are a great low calorie treat and I will keep buying them from Amazon.  Highly recommend this purchase! These are one of my favorite flavors of tic tacs.  The flavor is a true sour cherry and quite intense.  You really get a lot of flavor out of one 2-calorie treat, which can satisfy for quite a while! great thanks for the great service i dont know what else to say i have said all i have tu say. Very nice productfull of quality items - not the cheap candies like other baskets Were just what my wife wanted and she loves them. Next she will get the other type of bar by the same vendor. I love sorghum flour.  Its mild in flavor and smell, its easily mixed into flour blends for gluten free baking too.  Its one of my favorites along with millet, sweet rice, coconut and almond. I buy most of my flours from Bobs Red Mill in the 4-pack boxes, if only because having all the bags and boxes the same size makes it easier to store them.  Its good flour, and the bags a good size for baking for a small family - also a good shape that will stand up on the counter while you scoop flour out of it. My sister is alergic to wheat so I make her a lot of Gluten Free foods.  I searched local stores and could not find Sorghum Flour.  So I looked on Amazon and finally found it.  It was all packed wonderfully and arrived perfectly fine and Im already using it. I love baking with The Bobs Red Mill Sweet White Sorghum Flour. I use it in many things but I tend to lean toward sweeter treats such as Cakes and Muffins. I make a crumble topping with this flour that my family and guests beg for! I would highly recommend this flour to any baker, even more for the gluten-intolerant ones. I use normal recipes and just replace the wheat flour. It always turns out fantastic! I am a big fan of Sorghum flour for my baked goods. It gives everything a bit of sponge (especially cakes) and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking. I highly recommend this for baking flour mixes - you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor. Great product!The Stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural.Use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar.Tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener. I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is \"store fat!\" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasnt too crazy about the \"during taste\" either.Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I cant tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets! I used to use agave nectar and honey. Even though I picked organic, there was still more sugar than desired after I put in my recipes. I actually got Tinea Versicolor due to the sugars in those products.But this product is great. I use it in my protein shakes, smoothies, and baking recipes (muffins, breads), and its awesome.I make a chocolate milkshake and this stuff really rounds off the edges:- Cottage Cheese- Chocolate Protein Powder- Cacao powder- Almond Milk- Nustevia powderJust need maybe 1/4 cup of each ingredient and 1 cup of almond milk and it takes just like a sugary chocolate milk shake. This is the best tasting stevia powder Ive tried. Most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesnt. I recently bought a 5lb bag of it online and Im making my way through it. Cutting sugar out of our diet,we went to splenda. Then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry. We went to stevia no calorie powder, after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects. The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste. I also found that using a stevia that has an 80% ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that I have found. Because of using VERY SMALL amounts this jar lasts for months. This is also the best price ANYWHERE! Swanson is a trusted vendor as is Amazon. I am hooked on Stevia. Not only is it all natural but it tastes great and is truly a guilt free sweetner.Of all the brands I have tried NuNaturals is the best; it dissolves easily in ice tea and it does not have any bitter taste.I keep the packets in my car and my backpack for when I eat out, I use the stevia baking blend to replace sugar in all my muffins and cookies, and this is large 12 oz jar the best size for use at home. I keep a 1/4 tsp measuring spoon in the jar to spoon it out.I have given up all artificial sweetners. I no longer drink diet coke (and wont until they make it with stevia instead of splenda).If you have not used stevia before I urge you to try it. If you have used other brands and did not like them try NuStevia and you will be impressed. This has been the best tasting Stevia I have tried.  I also think this is a better value than some of the others.  I really like not having to open all the packets when I make a gallon of Tea. If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and wont leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you wont even miss it.~The Rebecca Review I hated Stevia and its licorice taste until I tried Nustevia.  Since that day, I have almost completely eliminated sugar in my drinks.  I like that it is a plant based product and not bio-engineered.  No after-taste and you need very little to make anything taste sweet. I dont like using artificial sweeteners because of the chemicals and because they dont taste good. I am a caregiver for my diabetic dad, and once I discovered this product I was hooked, except that it is hard to find where I live. When I found it at Amazon I put it on auto ship so I dont run out.  The price has gone up a lot since I first found it on Amazon, however, it still costs more in stores if and when I can find it there. I make limeade with this which I keep on hand at all times. In a gallon container of water I add 1 cup of lime juice and 2tbsp. of stevia powder. It is refreshing and almost no calories and no chemical aftertaste.  My dad uses the stevia in his coffee and his oatmeal. I havent tried cooking with it although I know they make one designed for baking, which Ill possibly try this winter. If you are trying to get off sugar, this is the product for you. I has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin, and no bitter aftertaste.  Great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy.  I love this product. I have tried various brands of stevia, but I always come back to NuNaturals.  I buy the 12 ounce container because I use it to sweeten everything.  If you have a sweet tooth as I do but dont need the added pounds, then this is the ticket for you.  I drink a lot of tea, and this is my sweetener.  A lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste, but this is the best that I have found to resolve that problem.  Highly recommended. If you need to cut down on sugar this is the way to go! I love Stevia in my iced tea and its great on your cereal also. Great stuff!! I started using NuStevia several years ago.  Back then I had to purchase it from a health food store.  Thanks to Amazon I can now order and have it within a few days.  I never run out!  As for the product, its the best.  Ive tried several Stevia products but they have an after taste.  Not with NuStevia.  Please try if you havent. I was looking for a healthier alternative to Splenda and Equal, NuStevia taste great and this container lasts a long time. Stevia is pretty much the only natural zero-calorie sweetener there is, but most of the time the powdered stevia is so bitter!  Not Nustevia!  Nustevia has absolutely NO bitterness, and tastes EXACTLY like real sugar!  Its amazing!  Add it to plain yogurt, you have an amazing guilt-free dessert, breakfast, side dish, snack.  Add it to tea, coffee, recipes, anything!  It is a truly magical product, and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on Amazon than anywhere else!  They also sell it at GNC, but it is $10 for 4 oz.  Also, for drinks, I highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia, as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages (it eventually does dissolve, though). I was quite skeptical about stevia at first, but tried it with another brand and thought there wasnt much difference in taste and I felt better about using a more natural product than the other artificial sweeteners out there. I then started looking at getting a bulk container and happened upon this product. I now have purchased this same product 4 times and am quite pleased. The product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitors.The deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging. We love this and use it as a sugar substitute in just about everything (beverages, desserts, cooking). It is not at all bitter, even in hot drinks like coffee. For baking, there are good substitution charts online that tell you how much stevia to use per cup of sugar ([...]). If you need to replace the \"bulk\" of sugar in a recipe, you also have to add homemade apple fiber to make it work ([...]). My kids dont notice the switch and I feel good about using it because its all natural. I am so happy I discovered this product. I had tried several other brands in extract and powder form and NuNaturals is by far the best. Virtually NO aftertaste, quick dissolving and convenient. It is also very economical at 1.5 cents a serving. I use a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon and it sweetens my coffee or tea perfectly. Do yourself a flavor and get this stevia powder - youll be happy you did! I discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee , tea and on fruit and oatmeal.  It was a lot less expensive in the packets then, but Ive switched to the large 12 oz. container and the price is very good. I dont use sugar and this helps me have the \"sweet\" and not the increased blood sugar-YEAH!! I love this stevia! I have tried MANY different kinds over the years and this one is my FAVE! Goes great in my coffee and tea. I have this one on auto ship and get one a month (makes it pretty cheap too!) I have tried every brand of stevia on the market and this is, hands down, the very best out there.  I use Nu-Naturals NuStevia for all sweetening purposes.  It can be hard to find even in health food stores and the ones that carry it usually charge a premium.  I was delighted to find it on amazon.com for a very reasonable price, even less when obtained through a standing order. this stevia is the best tasting weve ever tried. it also mixes into beverages more thoroughly than some others.the service from this buyer was prompt, the product arrived on time and in excellent condition. would order from them again, and recommend them to others.Linda blyth I ordered this after having much success with their liquid products. It is not bitter at all and has a very fresh/clean taste to it.  I have baked with it, used it on the stove, and in my oatmeal and hot cocoa.  When I run out, Ill be ordering more! NuNaturals Stevia is the only sweetener that I use in my beverages and cooking. I have tried other brands and this one is the best! It hasnt any odd taste, and tastes better than sugar to me. I buy the large 12 ounce container and it lasts me for months! I only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores. There is a soda that has stevia in it that I purchase at a health food store called Virgils Zero and it comes in different flavors...it is great and I dont have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas. This product is great and I think is the best of stevia products on the market. I find that this jar product works better for people without as much dexterity in their hands; vs using/opening sweetener packets.  This product works well both in cold & hot things like homemade lemonade & in coffee.  Easy to open lid. Product dissolves more easily in cold liquids, than many other types of stevia. I used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in Florida for 27 dollars. Where I moved to in NY I could not find it in the stores so I looked online. With shipping costs, it still cost under 20 dollars.I use this product in tea and coffee and I like it better than real sugar. I dont find it bitter at all even when I accidently put a little too much in ice tea. Sometimes I forget its not real sugar when its in ice tea. I especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste. I have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good. The first time I tried this product  was 2 years ago at the Venetian spa restaurant in Las Vegas  having  a cup of tea with some friends. We all remarked how delicious and tasty it made our tea.  Weve been using it ever since. A little goes a long way and I use it anytime I would ordinarily use a sweetener.  Since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and I have a sweet tooth, I felt this was a safe alternative. Not only is it safer, but theres no aftertaste and doesnt raise your blood sugar level. This particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it. Ive tried others before and since and theres no comparison. Very happy with the product.... in a taste test, for the price, it ranks very high.  Delivery was prompt and as expected. Love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill, great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank. Roland Red lumpfish Caviar is excellent.The price is good and affordable,it makes a good presentation for company, and tastes very good. I purchased many items from Amazon, even large ticket items, and I am very satisfied with the products and service. Because they brought bagels to America without which we never could get maximum level of enjoyment out of this delightful low cost caviar.  Caviar for breakfast!  We use the small soft plain bagels cut in two upon which we smooth a bit of cream cheese then a nice ring of caviar in the center of which is colorful and delicious cut up hard cooked egg then add a perfect cup of coffee.  This is is best done on a week end so it can be savored ever so slowly--no stress involved--pure luxury.  Yes, Yes, Yes, yes, yes. Not knowing what to expect I decided to take a chance since it wasnt that expensive.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the caviar.  I put this stuff on just about anything I could and it was amazing.  I dont know too much about caviar, but for this price I dont think anybody can complain. This is a joy to serve on my mini potato pancakes  with sour cream and then a teaspoon of this caviar on top. Soooooo tasty and pretty for Christmas. Thanks for offering it. All of the Roland products are top quality.  Rolands caviar is the real deal, unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed! if u have not tried this u r missing the best thing u could cook for your family.I give this 10 stars. Cooked in healthy coconut oil thats why it stays crunchy! Will not give you side effects of vegetable oil - oxidized cholesterol, transfats, rancidity, and free radicals when you eat foods fried in canola soybean or corn oil. Forget Starbucks, Peets or anything else. This is the real deal. Like a good vintage wine, Britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste! I am really fussy about coffee, and generally avoid it, but after a trip to Costa Rica fell in love with the beverage again! You have to use a French Press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions, your beans deserve the best, your taste buds deserve the best too. No I dont work for Britt and did not get paid to say this!!!!!  But if you guys at Britt read this send me a sample or two!! This  coffee is the smoothest dark roast coffee I have ever tasted,and it was a pleasure to sip this full bodied coffee before breakfast and after dinner. I love this coffee! Like the other reviewers, I took a trip to Costa Rica and was immediately addicted to this bold, flavorful coffee. I am a cover lover and have tried many different brands only to find that Britt is hands-down the best Ive ever had. I brought back one bag from Costa Rica and have started ordering my supply because I cant go back to other bland store-bought coffees. Definitely worth a try! You wont be disappointed. This coffee is delicious. It is full bodied and leaves a great almost chocolaty after taste. My dad told me about it after a trip to Costa Rica. My husband and I took a vacation to Costa Rica and had a wonderful time.  The whole time we were there we drank there Britt Dark Roast and loved the taste.  There was no bitter after taste, plus I normally drink decaf and noticed with the Britt regular dark roast it didnt bother me at all!!! I dont have to order decaf anymore and can enjoy the regular. I now order it on line and find it to be the best tasting coffee Ive ever had.Thanks for growing the best coffee beans in the world!!! Great tasting coffiee!! One of the best Ive ever had! The problem here is the high shipping costs. My husband and I fell in love with Cafe Britt coffee while we were in Costa Rica.  Upon our return we were delighted to see that we could order it through amazon.com!  The coffee is easy to drink - not bitter or harsh and is a great way to start your day.  Highly recommended. I first tried Britt dark roast when I was In Costa Rica.  It has a lot of rich flavor, but it is not bitter at all.  Ive boughtit by the case ever since.  Its really no more expensive than those \"gourmet\" brands you find at your local store.  This issimply the best coffee Ive ever had, and Ive tried many supposedly special ones over the years. I used Super Gold Luster Dust to create the most exquisite chocolate aspen leaves for the grooms cake at my sons wedding. By using an artists paintbrush to lightly coat the molded leaves with Luster Dust, the result was startlingly beautiful. In contrast to food coloring, the Luster Dust brushes on easily and imparts a realistically metallic color and sheen. The containers are small but the product goes a long way, making it extremely economical to use. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933981350\">The Step Dynamic: A Powerful Strategy for Successfully Growing Your Business</a> I have used this product multiple times.  In fact, I purchased four tubs of the gold and silver luster dust (2 each) five years ago and I am JUST NOW running out!  I use this stuff to gild all sorts of things for Renaissance themed banquets - including gilding an entire roast duck and then, using vodka, painting filigree designs onto it!  The clients thought it was prop food it looked so beautiful.  I cant recommend this stuff enough! This product allows me to make some really big splashes when providing spiced nuts at gatherings.  The fact that the gold spreads so easily allows me to use just a little but \"show off\"  People are amazed that this is edible gold I subscribe to several Hormel Compleats. This is definitely the best flavored dinner I have tried.  I am planning to double my subscription. These dinners are as close to perfect as can be found here in the mountains.  Quick, easy and delicious! Im not so sure why the other guy didnt like this so much, I LOVE IT!!  In fact, it might just be one of my favorite foods around.  Its tried and true, rarely cooks wrong, and always good to warm the belly and soul.  I only but this flavor, its so good, why deviate from it?  I have tried other brands before, bit Maruchan makes the best ramen noodles in all of time. Im on a quest to try all the Ramen Flavors. Ramen is a good lunch for me, being easy to make, cheap and versital. The Chicken flavor is one I remember but I havent had it in a long time, its one of the only flavors sold in stores where I live. I made some recently. Its better than I remember, salty but good. This is one of the more americanized flavors. I recommend NOT adding 2 cups of water. I added a bit more than 1 1/4 cup. and it was perfect. 1 1/4- 1 1/3 or 1 1/2 seems to be the perfect amount. I like eating it as a soup so I dont pour out the water. You can add things to Ramen like meat, eggs, or vegetarian protein and frozen veggies to make it a more filling meal or eat it plain. Or dont use the seasoning packet and add your own seasonings. Whatever you like. This is a great product, I recommend if you want easy, cheap lunches. This is a classic ramen choice.  Our kids, 3-6 love this.  When were RVing, we have a case of this on hand.  A bowl, some water, and 2:30 in the microwave, and weve got our instant meal. We break up the noodles while still sealed in the package.  This helps the kids not make a mess when trying to eat them. They dont seem to tire of these; and were not overly offended by the nature of the just-add-water-product. We each had our ramen-eating-college-days. These also make a great item to have on hand in a desk drawer for the days you forget your lunch, etc. at work.  Just make sure you have a pack of paper (not styro-save the enviro) bowls and some fork/spoons in that drawer, too. If you want a hot meal with no effort that is delious...this is the way. While cooking noodles...microwave left over meat/hot dog/boloni(sp?). Also, microwave a spoon or two of vegetable...left over/frozen/canned. After noodles cook/add season packet...pour over meat/veg...after a minute pour some of the liquid out...you have a wonderful meal with less sodium because you poured it out! College kids live off this meal because it is CHEAP/quick and can all be done in microwave if need be. You can get a case of Libbys carot/peas from AMAZON for about$11! Since you are using only a spoon or two...lasts a long time! With this spice mix, you can recreate the taste of your favorite restaurant stews.  It is potent, so do not use too much. It smells heavenly. Perfect for both meat and bean stews. Ive been eating the McDougall Right Foods for a few years now, and this is by far the best.  It takes exactly the way the name suggests.  It tastes great with cooked vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower, and it is very easy to make.  The only problem I have with it is that the noodles arent thick enough for me, but I think one time I let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick.  Other than that, Id recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor. <span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 1:38 Mins</span>skip the Pad Thai. go for this.edit: this soup has moved up to the #6 spot when I typed in Dr. McDougall today. Im glad, because I want to order this for a while, and dont want this soup to be seen as unprofitable by Right Foods (Dr. McDougall). I love the McDougall Asian Entr&eacute;es and although I havent tried all of them this one is amazing. It has a really peanutty flavor that you wouldnt expect in a product containing only 3 grams of fat per serving. I would imagine these would make a great dinner added to a pound of mixed stir-fry vegetables...I am buying a case now to test just that! The peanut flavor is strong enough that I bet itd distribute among a fair amount of vegetables or tofu when added so you wouldnt get very saucy noodles and dry veggies.I recommend this product. The best-tasting peanut noodle youll be able to find for only 3 grams of fat. This is a very tasty item. My wife doesnt eat meat and had to stayin a hotel for 4 weeks during a training she attended. I had this shippedto her and she raved about the great flavor and wanted more! Super tasty quick meal.  Its a bit small, but perfect for a lunch on the go.  Definitely not going to help you with any dinner hunger pangs though.The sodium is a little higher than Id like, but I really cant beat it for economic and efficient lunchfood. There are many workdays when I only have a few minutes for lunch or (all too often) dinner. On these days, Dr. McDougalls products are lifesavers! I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some broccoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little \"twigs\" - delicous!) By the time youre through cutting, youll have finished with cooking the soup and the soups \"standing\" time will be almost over. (It needs a few minutes to thicken up.) Take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.) If you can afford the calories, a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition, as well, as is tamari. YUMMY! These papers are great, they leave a delicious strawberry taste on your lips. Even the glue tastes good. These smell so good and are cute and a great size, with a bend in the middle to help roll, and holds together really well with tasty glue. Definitely recommend. Smell like strawberry bubble gum, doesnt really affect flavor too much, but better than plain ones and very sweet. Box says \"printed with soy ink\" so its clean and I dont have to worry about ridiculous chemicals for the graphics. These rolling papers are great they taste amazing and they burn slow and also prevent tar from running down the paper Love this soup.  I have been eating this soup for a long time. I have tried several different soups with these same types of ingredients, and this one is the best by far.  However, I will not order it from Amazon again.  I ordered a case, two different times, and the first time 6 of the 12 cans were dented.  The second order, the postal worker delivered it to me in a plastic trash bag because 2 cans were busted open, the other 10 cans, were dented with the labels coming off of them because of getting wet from the soup that had leaked from the busted cans.  It was a huge mess to clean up.  They need to package items better.  Amazon did issue a full refund, but after having 2 out of 2 shipments being damaged, I am not willing to order soup, or any other food items from them. Excellent. Very nice, rich and creamy with the pistachio nut in the middle. mmmm.....  Delish!!! If you want a good quick cooked sauce without excess acidity these are the ones to use. The real San Marzano, beware of imitators! Long ago I discovered that San Marzano tomatoes were unparalleled for flavor when it comes to making sauces. I tried many brands, and have done many side by side tasting comparisons, and Cento San Marzano tomatoes have consistently won out. These tomatoes have a deep and rich flavor, and a nice acid to sugar balance (though you may need to enhance this when making a sauce). Its pretty obvious when you pull these tomatoes out of the can that they were picked at their ripest, due to their deep red color and soft texture. Many tomatoes advertise themselves as San Marzanos, but since SM is a type of tomato, they could have been grown anywhere. Not these. These are SM tomatoes grown in the San Marzano region of Italy, in volcanic soils perfect for growing tomatoes. I have no affiliation with Cento, I just love a perfect tomato sauce. Use these tomatoes, be sure to not cook the sauce for more than 15 minutes, and youll see what I mean. Even using fresh, locally grown, in-season tomatoes I havent been able to get the depth of flavor that I do with the Centos. I wanted to make authentic italian margherita pizza at home so I ordered this and Caputo \"00\" flour.  These tomatoes are amazing,  and taste just liek the tomatoes at our favorite Italian pizza restaurant.  The label says there is basil in it but i did not detect visually or in taste any basil.  This stuff is jsut awesome.  I ordered another 8 cans.  Shipping kills though. As I was growing up my mother always made apple sauce cake for every birthday and special occasion.  After I was diagnosed with celiac I began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made.  After 6 years I gave up trying.  Then I saw this mix in the store 2 years ago and got very excited with the prospects.  When I make the cake I tweak the mix recipe a little. I add to the dry mix 1/4 cup coco, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 raisins. I use 3 large eggs, 3/4 cup apple sauce, 1/3 cup of oil and 1/3 cup water instead of what is listed on the bag.  This cake and the chocolate cake mix also made by Namaste are our familys favorites.  This includes my husband and children who are not celiac and are VERY picky eaters! I served this wonderful cake at a Christmas party at my house.  As the only celiac in the crowd, I decided to wait until the others had tried it, before revealing that it was gluten free.  Everyone raved over the great taste!  The package included directions for making the mix into a carrot cake, which is how I served it.  My own two boys said it was the best cake I had ever made, including the traditional wheat flour cakes I sometimes make for the rest of my family.  It was moist, spicy, and rich.  It reminded me of the cakes my grandmother made when I was growing up, and she was a terrific cook.  I highly recommend this one! This product arrived with the sanitary seal in place and in good condition.  After nearly 10 months in Iraq, being able to shake pepper out of this thing and smell it in the air is heaven compared to the tiny little pepper packets they give us that have little to no taste.  I really do love the smell of this pepper and it tastes great.  You may be better off buying it in the grocery store and not paying for shipping if you can manage that, though =) Not wanting to pay $9 per pound at the local mall for black jelly beans, I came to my favorite online store, Amazon. With free shipping I could not beat the price. I went from paying $9 per pound to $3.50 per pound. I was afraid that maybe the good deal meant that they were stale but to my suprise they were fresh and delicious. I bought them for my mother for Mothers Day because she did not get a chance to buy any for Easter. With 10 pounds, I had plenty to share with my friends too. These jelly beans are wonderful.  They are smaller than regular jelly beans but that doesnt take away the flavor.  I would recommand these to anyone. Licorice Jelly Beans use to be my absolute favorite in the jelly bean flavors (I no longer eat sugar).  These were bought as a gift, so I did get to try a few just to see how they  are.  Ive had many over the years before giving up on sugar and honestly have never had any with this good a flavor!  Also their customer service is excellent! I needed to contact them and they were very responsive and also willing to do just about anything to make sure even ONE customer is happy - something lacking in most companies these days.To compare - I tried a couple Jelly Belly licorice ones and to me they had a fruit flavor that was just wrong - not enough of a licorice taste.  Gimbals is less expensive this way and superior in every aspect of a licorice jelly bean.  This is a LARGE quantity!! Keep that in mind when purchasing - either have a lot of jelly bean lovers in your life, or a large family or collection of friends to share with - unless of course your sweet tooth wont stop and then, just savor them all yourself ;-)Enjoy! Soy milk is scrumptious and this variety has some extra nutrients added. Its a great, nutritious, high-calcium, no cholesterol product at a great price. Buy a case. I toss some of these in soups, or hydrate in a bit of hot water and add to salads or salad dressings. They add a nice somewhat meaty flavor, (almost like bacon bits but healthy), to almost any dish. MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!Hey guys,So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs.So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!THEIR ANSWERDear Dave,Thank you for contacting Natures One®.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Babys Only Organic® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDAs Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Babys Only Organic® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Babys Only Organic® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Babys Only Organic® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Babys Only Organic® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.Regarding our Babys Only Essentials® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Babys Only Essentials® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your childs healthcare provider.DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needsMost egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age. (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, \"The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,\" Allergy 56; 5:403I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your interest in Babys Only Organic® formulas. Please let me know if you have additional questions.Sincerely,LoriNatures One Inc.[...][...]Toll Free [...] HANDS DOWN the best formula on the market.  Sadly, my breast milk dried up so I had to fine a formula.  My poor son has so many GI, stomach, gas, crying, reflux, etc issues.  We were on Alimentum for over a month.  We even tried the ready to eat b/c I heard it was corn free.  I also tried the hypoallergenic version by Enfamel.  Nothing made him better.After researching DHA/ARA...I found some scary things.  Basically, it is made by using chemicals.  There are some babies that have had a horrible reaction to this b/c of the toxins.  You can google it.  Anyway, I found this organic formula that didnt have it in it (you can buy DHA/ARA seperate made from eggs organically and no chemicals).  I was nervous...b/c my son had so many issues...I didnt want to make it worse.  But I tried it!  Seriously, it has changed my sons life!  He is a completely different baby!  I no longer even give him acid reflux meds anymore...I mean of course it is still there...but that is how much better it is.  My son has been on this since he was 6 weeks.  I know it says toddler, but if you go to their site it is FDA approved for infants.  They say toddler b/c they fully support breast feeding for the first year.  It has the same cals, fats, nutrients, vit, minerals pretty much as the other leading brands...its just organic...no DHA/ARA..and they dont use corn syrup.  Seriously, try this formula! I cant believe I am the first to review this great product.We have been using <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM4JLC\">Earths Best Organic Infant Formula with Iron, 25.75-Ounce Canister</a> (which is also a great product) up until our little started showing signs of lactose intolerance. After consulting with the pediatrician, we started searching for a suitable alternative.Whilst Soy formulas are being offered as the \"lactose free\" alternative by many, our first preference was \"non-soy\" alternative. We also wanted a natural & organic product, free of those nasty chemicals and ingredients. After a considerable amount of research and shopping around, we found this was the best choice out in the market that was both lactose free and natural/organic.Our little one also took to this formula very well and doing a lot better on this formula. You can find this 6-pack for $40 dollars less at diapers.com.  No reason they should be charging this much. Our 9 month old originally was spitting up a lot. We had him 1st on Similac regular, then went to Similac Sensitive and finally to Similac Soy.  The soy did the trick. He was on similiac soy for the past 6 months. When the Similac recall went through, my wife became disgusted with Similac and suggested we try a new brand. I was reluctant but did so anyway.  We reminded ourselves that as babies get older, they become less fussy, less gassy and maybe they dont need SOY anymore if thats what they were used to. So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Babys only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.  Well, if adults like it, I am sure babies would too !  I am very happy thus far with our choice. We were going to get Natures Best, but read that the way they extract their DHA is not ideal. Glad I realized that.  So far so good ! We always thought that our baby would be stuck with SOY formula...thanks to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent intuition, we realized that is NOT the case.  I am happy about that since SOY can cause some hormonal problems.....babies and adults alike.  Thank you Babys only for making an excellent product ! When my daughter was an infant, she was allergic to something in my breastmilk and was put on Neocate which worked wonders for her allergic colitis.  For my son, we were therefore very careful when it came time to picking out a formula to supplement breastmilk.  His stomach does react when I have accidentally had more dairy than I can tolerate so my pediatrician recommended a lactose free formula, especially given our Asian background.  I wanted something organic, not soy, lactose free, and with as clean of a label as possible and this formula fulfills all of those criteria.  My son didnt like it at first, but now he switches easily between breastmillk and formula.  He has not been gassy nor spit up on it.  I really wish Amazon stocked it. I love pasta, but it does not love me.  I just dont seem to be able to digest it.  But this pasta, not only tastes great, it is so easy to digest.  And, as an added bonus, it is healthy & low in calories.  I have now tried every version of this pasta & they are all amazing.  Some reviewers complained that the pasta is too firm, but that is not the case.  You simply need to cook it a bit longer than regular pasta & then it is light as a feather. Because of how wonderful it tastes & because it is so light, you would think that you were eating homemade pasta.  Almost hard to beleive that this stuff comes out of a box! :-) I eat this pasta every day, without guilt. I love this pasta. I maintain my desired weight without any problem. You have to cook this pasta a little longer than normal pasta, but it is every bit as good. Each box is 8oz and usually I make 8oz mixed with some lean protein for a meal for both my husband and I, and if we have leftovers, its rare.  This time however, I had half of it leftover only b/c we felt full and couldnt eat anymore.  I wonder if this is b/c of the high amt of fiber. Whatever, this morning my hubby tells me hes down 3 lbs. too.  Im jealous. Also, Ive been on an eating binge almost 2 weeks, always feeling unsatiated. Last night I had no strong urges to eat snacks.  I ate an apple more out of habit to eat something than b/c I was truly hungry. I wont say this is the outcome for everyone, but I thought Id share.  Im using the leftover pasta in my bean soup tonight. Id like to eventually try the different varieties of shapes of pasta now, too. I love this stuff and only get it through Amazon.  It arrived on time and good condition and I enjoy it. Just a quick note... a very good friend of mine who also battles weight issues and love pasta turned me on to this product.  We bought a box at Whole Foods and I was impressed by the taste but especially by the low calories and high fiber content.  Amazingly its about 40% cheaper at Amazon than at Whole Foods, and being an Amazon Prime customer saved me on shipping.Ill be back for more soon.  I love quality and a bargain. Love this pasta.  I mix this with regular pasta for a meal, half and half.  Love the lower calories and the fiber content. My husband and I have been on a low carb diet for two years and I miss pasta most of all. Weve tried other low carb pastas and werent crazy about them, but we loved Fiber Gourmet. The taste is midway between white and whole wheat pasta. Unlike other low carb pastas, we didnt experience any side effects in terms of digestive issues (if you know what I mean). I cant wait to try other products from Fiber Gourmet. Love this pasta.  Does cook up a little firm, cooked it a bit longer. Had it with pesto very good.  My husband could not tell the difference so I know it is good.  He is very fussy. Wow ... this pasta tastes just like the real thing unlike the brands labeled as whole wheat pasta. I tried them many times and simply could not get the same pasta-eating experience.  I eat half the box at a time, which is about 4 ozs, and its so filling I cant eat more if I wanted. It keeps me satiated all night. I dont even get the urge to snack. This is like a miracle to me.  Even my children who are the absolute pickiest eaters in the world love this pasta and will eat it in substitute for the \"real\" (and unhealthy) alternative. The other reviews are absolutely correct in that you should cook it 2 - 5 minutes longer than you would cook other pasta or even what the box says.  Im not sure if Amazon will like this comment, but it is much cheaper on the Fiber Gourmet web site at about double the amount for the same price on the day I am writing this review. I am on a low carb diet and have lost 25 pounds.  I was so tired of eating meat all the time but too nervous to splurge on pasta until I came across this product on Amazon.  I cook it a minute or two longer than the directions and top it with full fat Greek yogurt and parm cheese and one serving is so filling and yummy.  Definitely cures my cravings and am now on subscribe and save.  My hubby and son love it too! I dont know how they do it but this product is too good to be true.  Half the calories of regular pasta!! Wow. Great product.  Recommended by Dr. Oz.  We love pasta but not the calories.  This is much better than whole wheat. I brought a box with me to visit my daughter and family.We all enjoyedjthe fiber gourmet light penne  very much. First of all, it is wonderful to have these pods delivered to my door free of charge.  On auto delivery, they are cheaper than the cheapest Senseo pods that I have found (Target/Walmart).  But check out the weight of coffee per Senseo pod vs. this particular Baronet coffee pod.  Not all Baronet pods are this weight, however, so check out the products carefully.  I guess I had better mention that the coffee flavor is great!  One order is for three boxes of these pods. These pods are so much better than the Senseo pods!  At 10 grams, these pods are packed with more coffee than the Senseo pods, making for a better, stronger, more flavorful cup of coffee.  I use these in my Melitta One-One.  Also love that each pod is individually packaged, so they stay fresh.  They come in a stand-up box dispenser which is nice too.  I cant understand the other reviewer here who didnt like the coffee - I love this decaf!  It really is the best pod Ive found.  Also the value here cant be beat.  Comes 3 boxes in each order, so in each order you get 54 pods!  And Baronet has so many flavors.  Do check on the other Baronet flavors, though, because all the Baronet pods are not 10 grams, and all the pods dont come individually packaged.  Stick to the 10 gram, individually packaged pods, you wont be disappointed.  I get three different Baronet coffee pod flavors, all on auto-delivery.  Highly recommend.  Yum. I had been using <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBH9YE\">Senseo Decaffeinated Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a> in my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XYLAA\">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup Stay or Go POD Brewer</a>. Although the Senseo coffee is very good, I wanted some variety. This is what I found and its excellent. The vanilla flavor is rich and most importantly, leaves no after taste. I drink tall cups, 16 oz, so what I am doing is using 1 of each type. The vanilla is strong enough that it still tastes great. The Senseo decaf is a little cheaper, so I do that as a cost saving measure. I also signed up for Subscribe and Save to further reduce cost.  If you like vanilla coffee and have a pod brewer, I am confident you will love this coffee. So many different flavors to choose from.  I ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful.  It was the only decaf french vanilla I could find.  I have decided to switch from my old brand to this one. This by far the best pudding mix, you dont see this on the store shelves.. Everyone seems to just buy milk chocolate pudding.. and I guess most dont like to cook pudding on the stove, it is best when pudding is cooked cooked.. Instant pudding does not equal this..  Carl Weve been searching everywhere locally for this putting.  I was so elated to find it on Amazon.  This is the only pudding my mother made her chocolate pies with and now the tradition continues.  Thank you so much Amazon!!! My honey has a serious sweet tooth, which I accommodate by preparing him a weekly dessert. Martha Whites Muffin Mix is very convenient to prepare because it only requires one-half cup of milk, which I toss into my cuisinart; and wah-la six beautiful muffins with virtually no prep time. They are moist, delicious, and economic. i followed the easy instructions and these turned out delicious. i ate them all. there were only 6 of them. i mixed 1/2 cup of milk into the dry mix and slowly mixed it together. i poured the mix into my sprayed cast iron 6 cup muffin pan. i cooked them in my small convection oven and they cooked up nicely. they were moist on the inside. the mixes were very fresh smelling and had a freshness date well into 2013. the pouch is a nice tough plastic one and will keep the mix fresh. it is very easy to open also. WE LOVE LOVE LOVE these muffins. They are moist and delicious !! We like them best the day you bake them. The 2nd day they do dry out a bit but are wonderful if you pop them in the toaster oven for a few min to warm them up, then they are good as new. Our only complaint is that they are DIFFICULT to find !! BUT DEF Worth every penny !! I brought 2 bottles.  One I carry in my pocket and the other for home.  I fell in love with this while on vacation in Belize.  Just a couple drops does the trick.  Packs a ton of flavor, but not too hot that it overpowers your food. I really like this soup.  It is mild and I dont like anything that is to hot.  IT is just right.  Has a good flavor and is something I can take to work and pop in the microwave. I would buy it again and again. This is quick, easy and portable, and I think it tastes great! Its my favorite flavor.'"

    "There are many different ways to mitigate overfitting in a neural network, collectively known as *regularization* techniques. One common regularization technique is called [Dropout](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dropout). In this regularization method, a set of neurons is randomly selected at each training step to be completely ignored. This is done so that the neurons in our network do not rely strongly on their neighboring neurons and we avoid the creation of [\"co-adaptations\"](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf) that do not generalize well to unseen data. This making the model more robust and less prone to overffiting.\n",

    "For experiments, it's very important that your model is only run **once** on your test set. As there is so much randomness at play, it's vital to not \"cherry-pick\" the best results, so optimize as much as you want on the validation set, but keep the test set until the end and all official results should be based on the single run of the test set (or whatever configuration was decided *before the experiment started*)."

Evaluate this configuration on how well it performs on the test set, and furthermore diagnose *what kinds of mistakes it makes*. Explain whether these mistakes are expected or not, and print some of these poorly classified reviews. Given the mistakes the model made, how would you then go back and try to improve the model or optimize the tuning steps?\n",

    "\n",
    "On heatmap of the confusion matrix, we can see that most of the well-predicted classes are 0 and 4 (the extreme classes) and when the model misclassify on predictions usually choose the immediate category. I.e if the actual class is 0 the model is often getting confused more with 1 or even 2 than with 3 or 4. this is happening with all the categories."

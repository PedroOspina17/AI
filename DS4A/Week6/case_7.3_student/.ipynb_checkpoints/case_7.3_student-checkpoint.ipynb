    "A/B tests are a powerful tool to conduct rapid experimentation and quickly learn about the preferences of your users. However, any A/B test you run must ensure proper randomization. It ensures that you will not accidentally exclude any user base and derive conclusions based on a biased sample. With an A/B test, one usually starts the experiment on a small percentage of users so as to mitigate risk. After this initial step, the experiment can be ramped up."

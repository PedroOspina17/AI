    "> \"Which of these $M$ products should I offer to customers with $X$ characteristics?\". \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, \"What movie $M$ should I recommend to an user that has watched $X$ movies in the last couple of days?\", \"Which of these $M$ ads should I play after user $X$ finished this video?\", etc. In order to solve these types of problems one usually implements an experiment by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Selecting a small sample of the total customer base\n",
    "   2. Offering some of the $M$ products to the sample at random or based on previous knowledge of the population \n",
    "   3. Recording the outcome of the offerings and track the positive/negative responses of the customers\n",
    "   4. Use the results above to create a plausible *strategy* to offer the products to the rest of the customers\n",
    "   5. Optionally, repeat the process with a larger sample using the knowledge we have gained so far\n",
    "\n",
    "One must carefully answer certain design questions when implementing experiments like this. For instance: *\"How shall we choose our initial sample?\"*, *\"How do we determine whether a customer response is positive?\"*, *\"What strategy is the best to follow?\"*, *\"How do we estimate the response rate of our strategy for our entire customer base?\"*. In this case, you will learn how to properly attack these questions."

    "**Business Context.** You are a data scientist at a large tech firm. You want to send a personalized email message to each person on your firm's mailing list to advertise the launch of a new service. The goal of this campaign is to maximize long-term engagement with this new service.\n",
    "\n",
    "One naive strategy would be to bombard each subscriber with messages of all types. However, this would violate the company's agreement with its email subscribers which limits the number of messages sent per week, and would also likely be harmful as members unsubscribe due to the burden of dealing with too many messages. Thus, for the purpose of this campaign, we will assume that we can send each subscriber at most one message, which will be selected from a predetermined set of message types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** The firm wants you to answer the following: **\"For any given customer, which message out of our predetermined set of message types should we send to that customer to optimize long-term engagement with our new service?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** Designing and evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention (e.g. sending a personalized advertisement) is a fundamental application of data science. In this case study, we will learn to solve the preceding problem through careful design of an experiment and careful consideration of causal effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "The case is structured as follows: you will (1) precisely define the objectives by which we want to evaluate the results of our experiment; (2) set up our experiment via appropriate sampling and assignment of messages; and (3) evaluate the outcomes using our custom-designed metric."

    "We assume that there is pool of subcribers $\\mathcal{S} = \\left\\lbrace 1,\\ldots, S\\right\\rbrace$ and for each subscriber we have a vector of $p$ attributes (features) $\\mathbf{X}_s = (X_{s,1},\\ldots, X_{s,p})$, for $s=1,\\ldots, S$. Examples of such attributes might include purchase history, response rate to previous advertisements, relationship depth, as well as demographic and geographic information. \n",
    "\n",
    "n addition, there is a pool of potential email messages $\\mathcal{M} = \\left\\lbrace 1,\\ldots, M\\right\\rbrace$ that we could send to each subscriber. A personalized messaging strategy will involve sending a single message from this set based on the attributes of a particular subscriber. For example, we might consider a strategy like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IF** subscriber is less than 31 years old **THEN** send them Message 1<br>\n",
    "* **ELSE IF** subscriber has responded previously to email advertisements **THEN** send them Message 2<br>\n",
    "* **ELSE IF** subscriber has Platinum status **THEN** send them Message 3<br>\n",
    "* **ELSE** send them Message 4.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In many situations, the dimension $p$ of the feature vector $\\mathbf{X}$ and the number $M$ of possible messages can be large.  However, for the purposes of this case, the subscribers in our dataset have only $p=1$ feature (a previously calculated *Marketing Indicator* of each subscriber) and there is a total of $M=2$ possible messages we planed to send (we will deal with more general instances when studying classifier algorithms in future cases). \n",
    "    \n",
    "Let us load the data and take a quick look at the *Marketing Indicator* vector of our subscribers. Our dataset also contains a pair of columns (namely the columns 'Message Sent' and 'Response') that we will study later in the case. "

For example, a customer with a deep relationship may be more responsive to detail-oriented messages or those referencing existing offerings with which the customer is already familiar.

    "**Answer.** We have many of the same risks with message assignments as we had when constructing the sample $\\mathcal{S}_0$. Suppose, for example, that customers who are more likely to respond to *any* message are assigned to Message 1 and the remainder are assigned to Message 2. Then Message 1 might appear to be more effective than Message 2 even if Message 2 is more effective on the population as a whole. (This is a classic example of Simpson's Paradox!) Some factors that could bias response rate include prior response to similar messages, relationship depth, or subscriber attributes associated with the new product being advertised. To avoid such biases, we can perform random assignment of messages to individuals within each strata that we identified during our customer sampling step."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** You are a business consultant with new clients that are interested in analyzing reviews of their products on Amazon (as opposed to Yelp). They want to answer business questions like: \"What are the most important factors driving negative reviews?\", \"Have there been any large changes to customer satisfaction/reviews over time?\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your main task is to **explore the given data and use the results of your investigation to engineer relevant features that could facilitate subsequent analysis and model-building**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The dataset provided is a large body of reviews related to movies and television left on Amazon between 1996 and 2014. When exploring our dataset, we will quickly encounter a familiar problem we discussed in the previous case: the word \"good\" is one of the most important words in both positive *and* negative reviews. Thus, we must develop methods to put \"good\" in the appropriate context."

Note that there are much larger datasets available at the same site. We can expect better and more consistent results on larger datasets (such as book reviews). Note that these datasets are compressed (gzipped), and they are in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format, with each line representing a review and each line being its own JSON object.\n",
